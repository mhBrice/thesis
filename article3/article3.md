1. Tree recruitment is a critical step to initiate species range shifts in
forest under climate change. While non-climatic factors may slow down sapling
establishment, canopy disturbances may promote episodic recruitment pulses of
migrating species. Yet, our understanding of the factors controlling tree
recruitment dynamics at range margins remains limited.

2. We used permanent forest inventory plots sampled from 1970 to 2018 in Québec,
Canada, to examine potential climate-induced shifts in the distribution of
saplings (diameter 1-9 cm), with particular attention to four temperate species
at their northern range limits (\emph{Acer rubrum}, \emph{Acer saccharum},
\emph{Betula alleghaniensis} and \emph{Fagus grandifolia}). We compared
latitudinal shifts in sapling distribution over time (from 1970-1981 to
2005-2018) among different disturbance levels as well as altitudinal shifts
among regions. Then, for each of the four species, we fitted a hurdle model to
quantify the role of climate, disturbances, as well as abiotic and biotic stand
characteristics.

3. Saplings of the four species increased in occurrences across Québec, except
for \emph{A. saccharum} which declined in the southern portion of the study
area. We found significant northward shifts in sapling distributions in
undisturbed forest plots for \emph{Acer spp.} and \emph{Betula}, as well as in
moderately disturbed plots for \emph{Acer spp.} only, but no shift at major
disturbances. Downslope shifts of temperate saplings at their northern margins,
albeit not significant, may signal the onset of a migration from marginal
populations found on hilltops. Our results highlight that, although moderate
logging can promote sapling recruitment, it was largely constrained by local
forest composition (abundance of conspecific and boreal trees), as well as
topographic position and drainage.


4. \emph{Synthesis} Temporal patterns of sapling recruitment provided an early
signal of northward migrations of temperate tree species and indicated that
important compositional changes are underway. However, disturbances can
influence the magnitude of range shifts and should therefore be taken into
account when projecting future species distributions. While moderate logging may
promote recruitment pulses of temperate species at their northern margins,
dispersal limitation, priority effect from boreal trees, as well as topographic
and edaphic conditions may greatly reduce potential northward shifts of
temperate species.

# Introduction


Spatiotemporal changes in tree recruitment may provide early signals of shifts
in species distributions under climate warming [@anderson-teixeira_altered_2013
@boisvert-marsh_shifting_2014; @sittaro_tree_2017; @zhu_failure_2012;]. While
adult trees may survive for a long time in suboptimal conditions, the
regeneration process involves a sequence of several important climate-sensitive
steps, i.e., flowering, pollination, seed production and germination, and
seedling establishment and survival [@bykova_temperature_2012]. Hence, compared
to adult trees, the distribution and composition of young recruits can change
rapidly in the face of environmental changes [@copenhaverparry_multiscale_2020].
Since species northern range limits are substantially controlled by their
physiological tolerances to minimum temperature [@arris_evidence_1989], tree
species are expected to shift their distributions toward higher latitudes in
response to climate warming. Consistent with these hypotheses, temperate tree
species in Québec have shifted their range limits northward and these shifts
were larger for saplings than for adult trees [@boisvert-marsh_shifting_2014;
@sittaro_tree_2017]. However, @sittaro_tree_2017 reported that these latitudinal
shifts were poorly correlated with climate warming and
@boisvertmarsh_divergent_2019 showed both positive and negative effects of
climate change variables on sapling recruitment at their range margins. This
apparent contradiction between the expected northward shifts and the underlying
driver may indicate that trees are responding to a complex suite of
environmental drivers [@boisvertmarsh_divergent_2019; @carteron_soil_2020;
@leithead_northward_2010; @solarik_priority_2019]. Because tree migration
ultimately depends upon successful recruitments in new locations beyond their
current range limits [@renwick_temporal_2015], determining what conditions can
facilitate or impede sapling establishment is a milestone in predicting future
tree species distributions [@copenhaverparry_multiscale_2020] and vulnerability
[@aubin_traits_2016].


Seed dispersal limitation is likely one of the primary constraints to tree
recruitment at range margins [@caspersen_seedling_2005; @renwick_temporal_2015].
Many species typically dispersed their seeds close to the parent trees, from a
few metres to a few hundred metres [@scheller_spatially_2005]. As such, many
studies have found that recruitment is highly dependent on the abundance of
conspecific trees [@caspersen_seedling_2005; @drobyshev_environmental_2014; @graignic_geographical_2014; @solarik_priority_2019]. Hence, migration at
the leading edge may not appear as a moving front following climate warming;
recruitment may occur episodically through rare long dispersal events or locally
through the expansion from isolated northern populations
[@pearson_climate_2006]. Marginal populations at
northern range limits (i.e. cryptic refugia) have likely played a key role in
postglacial tree migration and they may be as important in future range shifts
[@mclachlan_molecular_2005]. In the transition zone of
eastern North America, several temperate tree species are spatially constrained
on hilltops at their northern limits [@blouin_guide_2008; @gosselin_guide_2002]
likely due to warmer microclimate created by cold air drainage, i.e. cold air
flowing downslope and getting trapped into valleys and depressions
[@barras_supply_1998; @goldblum_age_2002]. Hence, contrary to the most common
predictions of shifts towards higher elevations [@beckage_rapid_2008], these
northern populations could possibly migrate downslope with climate warming
[@goldblum_age_2002]. Although this phenomenon could contribute to the northward
range shifts, it has not yet been documented.


In addition to species dispersal limitations, several other biotic and abiotic
factors could influence recruitment. For instance, resident boreal populations
could constrain establishment and survival of temperate species at their
northern margins potentially through direct competition and indirect alteration
of substrate quality [@solarik_priority_2019]. Indeed, several local-scale
studies found that the survival of seedlings of *Acer saccharum* was reduced in
boreal forests, principally because their soils have low pH, nutrient
availability and microbial activity, as well as high needle cover and different
mycorrhizal composition than soils of temperate forests
[@brown_non-climatic_2014; @carteron_soil_2020; @collin_conifer_2017;
@solarik_priority_2019]. It is unclear however how these local constraints are
translated to regional-scale recruitment patterns. Observed regeneration
patterns in the temperate-boreal ecotone of eastern Canada failed to support the
idea that there were strong barriers to potential temperate tree recruitment
into boreal forest patches [@barras_supply_1998; @fisichelli_temperate_2014].
Given these uncertainties, regional-scale studies modelling the influence of
suboptimal soil conditions on the recruitment process can provide useful
information to predict future forest dynamics.


Disturbances are essential processes to initiate natural forest succession and
regeneration by promoting tree recruitment in canopy gaps
[@attiwill_disturbance_1994]; it was therefore suggested that they could
accelerate tree range shifts [@brice_moderate_2020; @renwick_temporal_2015;
@serra-diaz_disturbance_2015; @turner_disturbance_2010]. Indeed, disturbance
events that cause mortality of persistent boreal trees could reduce competition
and increase resource availability, thus facilitating the establishment of
migrating species. Dendrochronological studies have reported that the
recruitment of many tree species during the last century was strongly
synchronised with canopy disturbances (recruitment pulse), such as insect
outbreak [@bouchard_tree_2006; @duchesne_canopy_2013], fire
[@bergeron_species_2000] and logging [@angers_comparing_2005]. The type,
severity and size of disturbances influence which species are able to establish
depending on several characteristics, such as shade-tolerance, dispersal ability
and vegetative reproduction [@bergeron_species_2000; @brisson_les_1988]. For
instance, moderate outbreaks in mixedwoods may favour the regeneration of the
mid-tolerant species, such as *Acer rubrum* and *Betula alleghaniensis*, whereas
shade-tolerant species, such as *Abies balsamea*, may recruit continuously in
small canopy gaps [@duchesne_canopy_2013].

Although a recruitment pulse following a disturbance is a common pattern in
forest succession [@bouchard_tree_2006], there is little evidence whether this
process could accelerate broad-scale species range shifts under climate change
[@renwick_temporal_2015]. Previous work in Québec showed that both natural and
anthropogenic disturbances of moderate severity (i.e., disturbances that removed
between 25-75% of the tree basal area) have led to an increased proportion of
warm-adapted tree species (thermophilization) in forests
[@brice_disturbances_2019] and promoted transitions from mixed to temperate
forests [@brice_moderate_2020]. However, most of these compositional changes
were associated with the high mortality of a dominant boreal species at its
trailing edge followed by the growth release of co-occurring temperate species,
while the contribution of tree recruitment was marginal [@brice_moderate_2020].
Some simulation studies have concluded that disturbances are unlikely to drive
extensive biome shifts in the coming decades perhaps because they would favour
mainly the rapid recovery of resident species [@liang_how_2018] or the invasion
by early-successional species [@vanderwel_how_2014]. Empirical studies have
reached conflicting conclusions. On the one hand, canopy gaps have been shown to
locally facilitate establishment of temperate species in mixed forests of
Ontario [@leithead_northward_2010]. On the other hand, disturbances had little
or no effect on the northern range shifts of tree saplings in the United States
[@woodall_assessing_2013]. @boisvertmarsh_divergent_2019 also found a modest and
generally negative effect of disturbances on new colonisations of temperate
species at their northern range limits. Given that forests are increasingly
subject to human disturbances, more empirical evidence is essential to
disentangle their role on forest regeneration dynamics under climate change.




Our understanding of the factors controlling recruitment within the
temperate‐boreal ecotone remains limited, where few broad-scale empirical
studies have assessed the influence of a large array of environmental conditions
on regeneration dynamics at range margins. This study investigates sapling
recruitment dynamics of four dominant temperate broadleaf species (*Acer
rubrum*, *Acer saccharum*, *Betula alleghaniensis* and *Fagus grandifolia*) at
their northern range limits in Québec, Canada. These four focal species have
recently experienced modest to large shifts in their northern range limits
[@boisvert-marsh_shifting_2014; @boisvertmarsh_divergent_2019;
@sittaro_tree_2017]. Specifically, we examine the following questions: (i) How
did the spatial distribution of sapling occurrence and abundance changed between
a historical and a recent survey? (ii) Do disturbances influence the northward
(in latitude) shifts of tree saplings? (iii) Are tree saplings of northern
marginal populations migrating downslope? (iv) How do stand composition,
topo-edaphic characteristics, climate and disturbances influence tree
recruitment at their northern range limits? To address these questions, we assessed regional changes in sapling occurrence and abundance across and
compared shifts in latitudinal distributions of saplings among different
disturbance severity levels. We also test for shifts in altitudinal
distributions among regions. We then investigated the relative importance of a
series of environmental factors on tree sapling recruitment (measured as the
number of tree individuals that reached a diameter at breast height (DBH)
between 1-9 cm during a time interval): climate, topo-edaphic factors, plot and
neighbourhood composition, and disturbances.



# Methods

## Study area and forest inventory data

We analysed recruitment of temperate tree species using forest inventory plots
in Québec, Canada. From 1970 to 2018 (and ongoing), the *Ministère des forêts,
de la Faune et des Parcs* [@mffp_placettes-echantillons_2016] surveyed
permanent forest plots approximately every 10 years across the forested portion
of Québec in order to document changes in forest productivity and growth. During
the same period, a complementary network of temporary forest plots was also put
in place in which each plot was surveyed only once principally to inform the
timber supply analysis.

The region surveyed by the inventory program extends from approximately
45$^\circ$ to 52$^\circ$ North latitude and covers six bioclimatic domains
[@saucier_cadre_2009]. The present study focuses on the western portion of
Québec forests, from the Sugar maple-basswood domain (in the deciduous zone) to
the Balsam fir-white birch domain (in the mixed boreal zone; Fig. \ref{fig3.1})
where there is a strong linear climatic gradient from south to north (Fig.
\ref{figC.1}) and where climate warming is strongest in meridional Québec
[@yagouti_homogeneisation_2006]. The natural disturbance regimes vary
considerably along the latitudinal gradient of the study area, with frequent
large-scale insect outbreaks in the northern mixedwood forests, and small
windthrows and treefall gaps in the southernmost deciduous forests. Similarly,
clearcuts are more frequent in northern regions, while in southern regions
partial cuts are more common (Fig. \ref{figC.2}).


Permanent and temporary plots are circular with a radius of 11.28 m and an area
of 400 m^2^. Within each plot, trees larger than 9 cm in DBH are identified to
species, measured and their vitality noted. In our analysis, we refer to these
individuals larger than 9 cm as adults. In permanent plots, saplings (DBH
between 1 and 9 cm) were identified and numbered within a smaller subplot (40
m^2^).

To study recruitment of temperate tree species, we first selected all permanent
inventory plots in the study area that had been sampled at least twice. We then
disregarded plots that were subjected to active reforestation by plantation
during the study period because we were interested in natural recolonisation
processes. Finally, we kept plots for which all studied environmental predictors
were measured (see below; Table \ref{tab:tab3.1}). This yielded a total of 4099 permanent
plots considered (Fig. \ref{fig3.1}).


In the analyses on shifts distribution, we compared a historical (1970-1981) and
a recent (2005-2018) inventory periods in order to maximise time interval
between measurements and detect long-term changes. The mean time interval
between the historical and the recent surveys was 39.6 years (sd = 5.3). To
model recruitment at their northern range margins, we subset the northernmost
bioclimatic domain where each species is found: the recruitment of *A. rubrum*
was analysed in the Balsam fir-yellow birch and the Balsam fir-white birch
domains, *A. saccharum* and *B. alleghaniensis* were analysed in the Balsam
fir-yellow birch domain, and *F. grandifolia* was analysed in the Sugar
maple-yellow birch domain (Fig. \ref{fig3.1}). Unlike the previous analysis, for
the recruitment model, we used all available plot measurements and analysed
recruitment between consecutive plot surveys to take into consideration multiple
recruitment events. The time intervals between plot surveys varied from 4 to 32
years, with a mean interval of 10.88 years (sd = 3.48).

## Environmental variables

Annual climatic conditions from 1960 to 2018, were extracted from a 2-km^2^ (60
arc sec) resolution grid over the entire study area using the ANUSPLIN climate
modelling software [http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/projects/3/8;
@mckenney_customized_2011]. Plot locations were intercepted with two bioclimatic
variables hypothesised to influence tree establishment, survival and growth: the
mean temperature during the growing season and the climate moisture index (CMI)
from May to September (Table \ref{tab:tab3.1}). To account for inter-annual
climatic variability and lag in vegetation response to climate, climate
variables were averaged over a 10-year period prior to the plot measurement.
Climate change in each forest plot was measured as the slope between the climate
variable over time from 1950 to 2018. During this period, growing season
temperatures have increased by 0.17 $^\circ$C/decade in the plots, while CMI
have shown no significant trend (Fig. \ref{figC.3}), but the magnitude of
climate change varies across the study area (Fig. \ref{figC.1}).

We also collected information pertaining to natural and anthropogenic
disturbances that have affected the forest plots during the study period (Table
\ref{tab:tab3.1}; Fig. \ref{figC.2}). At each plot, the type of disturbances (21
types) and their levels of severity were recorded during field surveys [see Fig.
\ref{figC.2} for details; @mffp_placettes-echantillons_2016]. For our analyses,
we differentiated two main types of disturbances: natural disturbances and
logging. Three levels of severity were originally defined by the MFFP (minor,
moderate or major) depending on the proportion of basal area affected (Table
\ref{tab:tab3.1}). We kept all three levels of logging, but for natural
disturbances, we combined the major and moderate levels together because not
enough major disturbances affected the studied species, hence their effect could
not be estimated.

Core samples were also collected on selected trees deemed representative of the
forest plot during surveys to measure their age
[@mffp_placettes-echantillons_2016]. Stand age was estimated as the mean of
these measures to account for forest succession processes after disturbances.



At each plot, several topographic and edaphic characteristics were recorded
[@mffp_placettes-echantillons_2016]. To capture topographic conditions, we
selected plot altitude and position along the slope (lower, middle or upper
slope). We also selected drainage (xeric, mesic, hydric) and pH (low, medium, high)
because they largely affect nutrient availability, soil structural properties
and vegetation development [@tan_environmental_2009].

We measured the total tree basal area of all adult trees (DBH $\geqslant$ 9cm)
of boreal species (here, *Abies balsamea*, *Larix laricina*, *Picea glauca*,
*Picea mariana* and *Pinus banksiana*) to compute an approximate index of local
competition and priority effect on soil conditions [@solarik_priority_2019].
Similarly, we computed the basal area of conspecific adult trees of the focal
species (i.e. one of the four temperate species under investigation) to
approximate local seed availability; when conspecific trees are abundant in the
plot, we expect higher seed availability. We used the temporary inventory plots
to describe neighbourhood forest composition and account for potential seed
sources from surrounding populations. Around each permanent forest plot, we
extracted the 100 nearest temporary plots located within a 10-km buffer zone. We
chose a radius of 10 km as a compromise between a realistic dispersal distance
and the assurance of finding a sufficient number of temporary plots in the
buffer zone. Within the buffer, we computed the mean basal area per hectare of
the focal tree species, weighted by a negative exponential kernel distance to
the given permanent forest plot. This kernel makes it possible to grant a
monotonously decreasing importance to the populations that are located further
away.

## Analyses


### Changes in sapling latitudinal and altitudinal distribution

We investigated in details the temporal change in the sapling spatial
distributions of the four most abundant temperate deciduous species that reach
their northern limit in the study area: *Acer rubrum*, *Acer saccharum*, *Betula
alleghaniensis* and *Fagus grandifolia*. We examined whether the latitudinal and
altitudinal distributions of saplings of these four focal species changed
between a historical (1970-1981) and recent (2005-2018) inventory period. For
each time period and each tree species, we selected all plots containing at
least one sapling occurrence and extracted the latitude and the altitude of the
plots. We then tested for latitudinal and altitudinal shifts between time
periods for all selected plots using Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests
[@siegel_nonparametric_1988]. This nonparametric test quantifies the shift in
location (median) between the distributions of two samples. The before-after
distributions are not paired because saplings may occur in different plots
during the two time periods. We compared the latitudinal shifts among
disturbance levels and the altitudinal shifts among bioclimatic domains using
the same tests.


### Recruitment model

To identify environmental drivers of sapling recruitment, we analysed
recruitment between consecutive plot surveys of the selected study area (not
only the historical and recent surveys, but all measurements in between) for
each of the four temperate species independently. Hence, for any focal species,
we modelled recruitment counts observed between $t$ and $t + \Delta t$.
Explanatory variables related to climate change ($\Delta$TP and $\Delta$CMI) and
physical characteristics (altitude, pH, drainage and slope position) were
considered as static (their value for a given plot does not change through
time). Climate (TP and CMI) and disturbances (logging, natural and age) were
included as time-varying explanatory variables. Climate variables at time $t$
were used to model recruitment events between $t$ and $t + \Delta t$.
Disturbances that occurred during the interval $t$ and $t + \Delta t$ were used
to model recruitment events during the same time period. The probability of
observing recruitment events in a forest plot depend on the time interval
between surveys. Because of the variation in time intervals in the dataset, we
included an exposure variable in the hurdle models (i.e., an offset on the
logarithm of time interval). All quantitative explanatory variables were
standardised to mean 0 and standard deviation 1 prior to running the models.

Recruitment is usually represented as a count variable, i.e. number of recruits.
Because of the nature of the regeneration process, recruitment data often
present a large amount of zero records, i.e. inventory plots with no recruits.
The Québec data showed that a very large number of plots had zero counts
(between 80 and 90% of zero counts). This implies that the number of zeros is
higher than expected at random from conventional distributions, such as Poisson
and negative binomial [@zuur_mixed_2009].

We therefore chose to use a hurdle model to include excess zeroes in the
modelling process [@zeileis_regression_2008; @zuur_mixed_2009]. A
hurdle model has the following two parts: first, the zero hurdle part models a
right-censored outcome variable indicating plots without ($Y = 0$) or with
recruits ($Y = 1$, where all counts larger than 0 are censored, that is, given a
value of 1). This part can be fully modelled as a binomial process (logistic
regression), including covariates or not. Second, the truncated count part
models the number of recruits for those forest plots with recruits (for those
with $Y > 0$). The counts can be modelled with a truncated Poisson or truncated
negative binomial model, including covariates or not. We used a negative
binomial to model the counts to allow for extra overdispersion in the positive
(non-zero) part of the data. The model allows for a set of predictors for the
probability of a zero response and a different set for the mean of nonzero
responses.

Ecologically, it is relevant to consider these two processes separately because
predictors that determine the presence-absence of recruits can be different
from those predicting their abundance. Therefore, the zero hurdle part can be
interpreted as a regular logistic model, while the count part can be interpreted
as a truncated negative binomial model [@zuur_mixed_2009].

Using a binomial distribution to model the presence and absence of recruitment
$f_{binomial}$ and a negative binomial to model the number of recruits
$f_{negbin}$, the probability function of the hurdle model $f_{hurdle}$ is given
by:

$$ f_{hurdle}(Y = y | X, Z, \beta, \gamma) =
  \begin{cases}
    f_{binomial}(0 | Z, \gamma)        & \quad \text{if } y = 0\\
    \frac { 1 - f_{binomial}(0 | Z, \gamma)}{ (1 - f_{negbin}(0 | X, \beta)) } \times f_{negbin}(y | X, \beta)  & \quad \text{if } y > 0
  \end{cases} \text{,}
$$

where $Y$ is a random variable representing the observed number of recruits and
$y$ is the outcome variable, $Z$ and $X$ are matrices of predictor variables in
the zero part and count part, respectively, and $\gamma$ and $\beta$ are the
corresponding vectors of coefficients [@zeileis_regression_2008].

We can model the probability of zeros $P(Y = 0) = \pi_i$ and the mean $\mu_i$ of
positive count data in a forest plot $i$ using the predictor variables $Z_{i}$
and $X_{i}$ with the following logistic and log-linear regressions:

$$ logit(\pi_i) = ln(\frac{\pi_i}{1 - \pi_i}) = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 \times Z_{1i} + ... + \gamma_n \times Z_{ni},$$

$$log(\mu_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times X_{1i} + ... + \beta_n \times X_{ni}.$$

In our model, we tested the same initial set of predictors in $Z$ and $X$ (all
variables in Table \ref{tab:tab3.1}). We then performed stepwise backward
selection procedures based on Akaike information criterion [AIC;
@zuur_mixed_2009] on each part of the hurdle models independently to reduce the
number of predictors and keep the most relevant ones. The full hurdle models
were then run with the selected predictors. Regression coefficients were
estimated by maximum likelihood. We evaluated the goodness-of-fit of the four
models (one for each species) against the baseline model using likelihood ratio
tests [@zeileis_regression_2008], which evaluate if the addition of one or more
new parameters significantly increases the likelihood of the model. We also
compared and ranked the importance of each tested predictor using a likelihood
ratio test. Starting with a full model containing all the selected predictors,
we removed each of the terms one after the other to understand their
contribution to the likelihood.


All analyses were performed using the R programming language version 3.6.1
[@r_core_team_r_2019]. The list of R packages that were used to carry out the

# Results


## Temporal changes in sapling occurrence and abundance

All four studied species experienced increases in their occurrence and their
mean abundance throughout the study area, except for *Acer saccharum*, which
experienced occurrence losses in the two southernmost bioclimatic domains (Fig.
\ref{fig3.2}). The number of plots with *A. rubrum* saplings increased in all
domains and more than doubled in the two northernmost domains; its abundance
within these plots also increased, particularly at its northern limit, in the
Balsam fir-white birch domain. Occurrences of *Betula alleghaniensis* increased
across its range, but its mean abundance did not change much. Occurrences of
*Fagus grandifolia* doubled in both Sugar maple domains and new occurrences
appeared at its northern range limit, located in the Balsam fir-yellow birch
domain. *F. grandifolia* also doubled in abundance throughout its range.



## Latitudinal shifts in sapling distributions

When considering all forest plots together, sapling latitudinal distributions
shifted significantly northward through time only for the two *Acer* species
(shifts in distribution medians were: $\Delta_{50}$ = +19.3 and +13.2 km for *A.
rubrum* and *A. saccharum*, respectively; Fig. \ref{fig3.3}), whereas we did not
observe significant shift for *B. alleghaniensis* and *F. grandifolia*.


Latitudinal shifts were, however, influenced by disturbance severity. We found
northward shifts in distributions for *A. rubrum*, *A. saccharum* and *B.
alleghaniensis* in undisturbed forest plots (minor; +18.0, +27.0 and +26.5 km,
respectively). At moderate disturbances, only the two *Acer* species experienced
significant shifts. For *A. rubrum*, the shifts were similar for moderate or
major natural disturbances (+20.1 km) and moderate logging (+23.7 km). For *A.
saccharum*, the shift was larger under natural disturbances (+20.3 km) than
under moderate logging (+9.8 km). No significant shift was found for both
species at major logging. For *B. alleghaniensis*, the latitudinal shift was
only significant at minor disturbances and was hindered at higher disturbance
levels. We found no significant shift for *F. grandifolia* for all disturbance
levels.


Species latitudinal distributions do not strictly parallel the temperature
gradient because it is also influenced by topography. Hence, part of species
distributional shifts may not be captured by latitudinal shifts. We thus
examined species shifts based on their temperature distributions (mean
temperature of the growing season during the historical period) and observed
similar patterns for all four species (Fig. \ref{figC.4}) which confirm our
previous results (Fig. \ref{fig3.3}).

## Altitudinal shifts in sapling distributions

We observed no significant shifts in altitudinal distribution for all four
species across bioclimatic domains (Fig. \ref{fig3.4}). However, the
distributions of all four species presented trends towards downslope shifts,
especially at their northern range margins. For example, the median distribution
of *A. rubrum* shifted downslope by -64.5 m of altitude.

## Drivers of sapling recruitment

Sapling recruitment of each of the four temperate tree species at their northern
margins was influenced by a different set of environmental factors (Fig.
\ref{fig3.5}). The explanatory power was much higher for the zero part (McFadden
Pseudo-R^2^ from 20 to 45%) than the count part of the hurdle models (2 to 5%)
indicating that we can adequately explain where and when a recruitment event
occurred, but not how many did occur. For all species, the biotic variables were
the most important, especially the predominance of conspecific adult trees in
the plot (focal~plot~), followed by the physical variables, whereas the
importance of the other variables varied across species (Fig. \ref{fig3.5},
\ref{figC.5}). The hurdle regression models were all statistically significant
(i.e., likelihood ratio tests compared to an intercept only model were all
highly significant with *p* $\leqslant$ 0.001) and showed a good fit to the data
(i.e., rootograms indicate a good match between the expected and observed
frequencies; Fig. \ref{figC.6}).

The basal area of conspecific trees in the plot (conspe~plot~) and in the
neighbourhood (conspe~neigh~) had a strong positive effect on the presence (zero
part) and number of recruits (count part) for all species (Fig. \ref{fig3.5}),
except for *B. alleghaniensis*, for which conspecific trees in the plot had a
negative effect on the number of recruits. The predominance of conspecific trees
in the plot was particularly determinant for *A. saccharum* and *F. grandifolia*
compared to other variables (Fig. \ref{figC.5}). The total basal area of boreal
trees in the plot (boreal~plot~) had a strong negative effect on all species.


Physical variables were also very important to predict the presence and number
of recruits, especially for *A. rubrum* and *B. alleghaniensis* (Fig.
\ref{fig3.5}, \ref{figC.5}). For all four species, probability of recruitment
was higher on hilltops (upper slope, and less so mid slope, compared to lower
slope). Altitude influenced *B. alleghaniensis* (negative) and *F. grandifolia*
(positive). Poor drainage (hydric compared to mesic soils) had a strong negative
effect on all species, while excessive drainage (xeric soils) only affected *F.
grandifolia*. The number of recruits of *A. rubrum* and *F. grandifolia* were
also lower on hydric soils. Soils with low pH appear beneficial for saplings of
*B. alleghaniensis* (compared to medium pH). Soils with high pH had positive
effect on both *Acer* species and negative on *F. grandifolia*.

Among the climate variables, temperature always had a positive effect on on both
the presence and the number of recruits, while CMI had a positive effect on *B.
alleghaniensis* only and a negative effect on *A. rubrum* (Fig. \ref{fig3.5}).
The effect of climate change varied across species; increased humidity
($\Delta$CMI) was associated with higher probability of recruitment of *A.
saccharum*, *B. alleghaniensis* and *F. grandifolia*, but a lower probability
for *A. rubrum*. Climate warming ($\Delta$TP) had a positive effect on the
presence of *B. alleghaniensis* and negative on *F. grandifolia*. Moreover,
climate warming had a positive effect on the number of *A. rubrum* recruits, but
a negative effect on *A. saccharum*.


Finally, all disturbances promoted the recruitment of *A. rubrum* (Fig.
\ref{fig3.5}). Moderate logging generally increased the presence and number of
recruits for all species. Major logging decreased the probability of recruitment
of *B. alleghaniensis* and, to a lesser extent, of *A. saccharum* and *F.
grandifolia*. Interestingly, the number of recruits of all four species strongly
increased with major logging and, less so, with moderate logging. Natural
disturbances had a negative effect on the presence and number of recruits of *A.
saccharum* and *B. alleghaniensis*. Recruitment of *A. saccharum* and *F.
grandifolia* was more likely to take place in older forest plots (age), whereas
more *A. rubrum* recruits were found in younger forests.

# Discussion


In this study, we used the Québec forest inventory data to examine the
distributional shifts in forest regeneration resulting from climate change and
to disentangle the underlying environmental drivers of recruitment processes.
First, our results showed important changes in the spatial distribution of
temperate species recruitment. We observed large increases in the occurrence and
abundance patterns of the four studied species, except for *A. saccharum* which
declined in the southern portion of the study area. Secondly, we provided
evidence of significant northward distribution shifts, but these were affected
by disturbances. Saplings of *A. rubrum*, *A. saccharum* and *B. alleghaniensis*
experienced northward shifts in undisturbed plots. However, only the two *Acer*
species shifted at moderate disturbances (natural or logging). There was no
significant shift at major logging. Thirdly, our results may signal the onset of
a migration from marginal populations found on hilltops as temperate saplings at
their northern margins tended to shift downslope, although this trend was not
significant. Finally, we analysed the effect of a large array of environmental
conditions on species recruitment to assess how they could control the observed
distribution shifts. The hurdle models highlighted that sapling recruitment at
species range margins is primarily constrained by stand composition, as well as
topo-edaphic characteristics, and facilitated by partial logging. Together, our
results suggest that moderate logging may promote recruitment pulses of
temperate species, but its catalysing effect on northward shifts may be limited
due to other abiotic and biotic constraints.


## Temporal changes in composition and abundance
<!--
Forests of the temperate-boreal ecotone are expected to undergo dramatic
compositional and structural shifts in response to climate warming
[@evans_borealtemperate_2017]. The current distribution of adult trees is mainly
a response to past conditions (i.e. climate, disturbances, management, etc.),
while the presence and abundance of saplings reflect a response to more recent
changes in environmental conditions. Here, we showed that the composition of
saplings is becoming more dissimilar relative to the composition of canopy trees
over time. Assuming that the composition of saplings should be representative of
the future tree composition of a forest stand, this result signals that
important forest community changes are underway. The ubiquity of this
compositional shift across the study area entails an equally ubiquitous
underlying cause, such as climate change or human disturbances. It is consistent
with many modelling studies predicting large species turnover through time in
response to climate change [@boulanger_climate_2017; @mckenney_potential_2007;
@chen_modeling_2002]. Moreover, this growing gap between regeneration and canopy
trees suggests that previous studies of community changes based on mature trees
only [e.g., @brice_disturbances_2019] might underestimate the sensitivity of
forests to future environmental changes.

Forests of the temperate-boreal ecotone are expected to undergo dramatic
compositional and structural shifts in response to climate warming
[@evans_borealtemperate_2017]. The current distribution of adult trees is mainly
a response to past conditions (i.e. climate, disturbances, management, etc.),
while the presence and abundance of saplings reflect a response to more recent
changes in environmental conditions. Here, we showed important changes in
sapling occurrences and abundances of the studied tree species. Saplings of *A.
rubrum*, *B. alleghaniensis* and *F. grandifolia* experienced large increases in
occurrences in all domains where they are found, indicating colonisation of new
habitats. The extensive expansion of *A. rubrum* has been observed across
eastern North America [@fei_evidence_2007]. In contrast, *A. saccharum*
experienced a loss in the number of occupied plots over time in the southern
portion of its range (i.e. in the two sugar maple domains), but a gain at its
northern limit. While the mean abundance of *B. alleghaniensis* was relatively
stable over time, the mean abundance of the other three species increased
strongly, particularly *F. grandifolia*. The recent decline occurrence of *A.
saccharum* and the concomitant expansion of *F. grandifolia* in the forest
understory of southern Québec has been previously reported and has been related
to differential responses to disturbances and atmospheric acid depositions
[@bal_nutrient_2015; @nolet_relationship_2008], discussed in more details below.


## Northward shifts

The regional changes in sapling occurrences entailed a northward shift in the
distributions of *A. rubrum* and *A. saccharum*, whereas the shift in *B.
alleghaniensis* was significant only in undisturbed plots (minor; Fig.
\ref{fig3.3}). These shifts in latitudinal distributions provide further support
for the hypothesis of climate-induced migration. Despite some differences in the
study area and the methodology, our results are qualitatively similar to those
of previous studies in the same region [@boisvertmarsh_divergent_2019;
@sittaro_tree_2017], with large and significant northward shifts for the two
*Acer* species, but no or weak shift for *B. alleghaniensis* and *F.
grandifolia*.


Temperate species such as *A. rubrum* and *A. saccharum*, whose limits fall in
the southern part of the boreal forest and the northern part of the temperate
forest, respectively, have been shown to establish in northern mixedwoods and
boreal forests [@fisichelli_temperate_2014; @goldblum_age_2002;
@leithead_northward_2010]. *A. rubrum* is a recognised "super-generalist" and
opportunist species [@abrams_red_1998; @burns_silvics_1990; @fei_rapid_2009].
*A. saccharum* is generally categorised as a shade‐tolerant late‐successional
species [@burns_silvics_1990], but @nolet_successional_2008 suggested that it
should also be considered a generalist trans-successional species, as it is well
adapted to different successionnal stages. Their broad environmental tolerance,
combined with warmer temperature in the last decades (Fig. \ref{figC.3}),
probably allowed colonisation of new sites at their northern margins and
facilitated their northward range shifts. Besides, although we did not test it,
it is possible that the presence of *A. rubrum* in northern sites facilitates
the migration of *A. saccharum* through as species form arbuscular mycorrhizal
associations.


Importantly, our results show that disturbances did not promote larger range
shifts but can influence differentially the migration of temperate species.
Indeed, both moderate and major disturbances clearly hindered the northward
migration of *B. alleghaniensis*, which could explain why it was not detected in
previous studies in the same region [@boisvert-marsh_shifting_2014;
@boisvertmarsh_divergent_2019]. In contrast, both *Acer* species experienced
northward shifts of similar magnitude at minor and moderate disturbances
(natural or logging), but did not shift at major disturbances. Hence, it appears
that only major disturbances could impede their migrations. Our findings provide
further insight into the conclusions of @woodall_assessing_2013. During a 5-year
study in the northeastern United States, they compared seedling and adult range
margins and reported that disturbances either had no effect or induced a
tendency towards range retreat for some species [@woodall_assessing_2013].
Together, these findings highlight that future tree range shifts may depend upon
species tolerance to disturbances and disturbances should therefore be taken
into account in future studies of range shifts. As we only investigated four
dominant species, it is highly likely that the distributions of other tree
species, as well as understory plants, are similarly altered by disturbances.

## Downslope shifts

Although the altitudinal shifts that we identified are not statistically
significant, some interesting regional patterns are beginning to emerge: at
their northern range limits, saplings of the four tree species presented slight
(albeit not significant) downward trends (Fig. \ref{fig3.4}). Contrary to most
predictions regarding temperate tree migration along elevation gradients [e.g.,
@beckage_rapid_2008], this downslope migration is not surprising as the studied
species are spatially constrained on hilltops at their northern limits
[@blouin_guide_2008; @gosselin_guide_2002]. Accordingly, our models indicated
that recruitment was generally higher on upper and middle slope, compared to
lower slope, especially for *A. rubrum*. Topographic position is known to
influence forest microclimates, notably through cold air drainage
[@zellweger_advances_2019]. This phenomenon was hypothesised to explain the
presence of isolated populations of *A. saccharum* on hilltops at its northern
range limit [@barras_supply_1998; @goldblum_age_2002]; it could also contribute
to explaining the distribution of the other three species. Our results suggest
that temperate species could be starting to expand their ranges from existing
isolated populations on hilltops to nearby habitats downslope.



## Drivers of sapling recruitment

Our hurdle model first highlighted that the presence of recruits in a site and
their abundance are two distinct processes that are controlled by different
environmental factors. Moreover, the high of explanatory power of the zero part
relative to the count part of the model suggests that the occurrence of a
recruitment event is strongly controlled by the biotic and abiotic drivers
whereas their abundance is more random.


### Biotic conditions

The best single predictor of tree sapling occurrence and abundance across
species was the basal area of conspecific adult trees within forest plots (Figs
5, \ref{figC.5}). The predominance of conspecific trees, mainly in the plot but
also in the neighbourhood, may reflect a reliable source of seeds and the
possibility of vegetative reproduction. It may also correlate with the
appropriateness of the environmental conditions for the species. This finding is
consistent with other studies that emphasised high positive conspecific density
dependence for tree recruitment [@caspersen_seedling_2005;
@drobyshev_environmental_2014; @graignic_geographical_2014;
@solarik_priority_2019].

Many studies have shown that recruitment is limited by seed supply and all the
more so at the northern distribution limit [@caspersen_seedling_2005;
@tremblay_potential_2002]. For instance, @tremblay_potential_2002 showed that
northern populations of *A. rubrum* are maintained essentially through
vegetative reproduction with occasional sexual recruitments which, in
combination, allow this species to colonise recently disturbed sites. In
Ontario, @caspersen_seedling_2005 reported an elevated recruitment failure for
*F. grandifolia* which was mainly due to low seed fecundity. This species
regenerates abundantly by root suckers or by stump sprouts and these have a
better survival rate than seedlings [@beaudet_effect_2007; @beaudet_beech_2008;
@morris_mature_2014]. Its reliance on vegetative reproduction may explain the
disproportionate importance of conspecific tree cover for *F. grandifolia*
recruitment (Fig. \ref{fig3.5}, \ref{figC.5}) as well as the absence of range
shift (Fig. \ref{fig3.3}). The production of vigorous root sprouts may also
contribute to its competitive advantage over *A. saccharum* in the shared
portion of their range [@beaudet_effect_2007; @beaudet_beech_2008], where *A.
saccharum* recruitment was found to decline (Fig. \ref{fig3.2}).
@beaudet_effect_2007 suggested that where *F. grandifolia* reproduces
predominantly vegetatively, it might maintain a growth advantage over *A.
saccharum* under both shade and light conditions. In the northern part of its
range, *A. saccharum* is increasing, presumably because it is escaping
competition by *F. grandifolia*.

The basal area of boreal species in the forest plots exerted a large negative
effect on the recruitment of all species. The cover of boreal trees may be
indicative of several environmental conditions unsuitable for temperate tree
recruitment [@collin_conifer_2017; @solarik_priority_2019]. For instance, high
boreal cover is negatively correlated with temperate cover and mean temperature,
hence it may partly account for the effect of a latitudinal temperature
gradient. Boreal tree cover could also impede early sapling recruitment through
the direct competition for nutrients, light and water. Moreover, boreal species
create poor and acidic soils with high needle cover which can ultimately impede
the recruitment of temperate tree species through an inhibitory priority effect
[@collin_conifer_2017; @solarik_priority_2019]. Similarly, under boreal canopy,
the insufficiency of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi may strongly constrain
temperate species recruitment [@carteron_soil_2020]. Although we do not have the
data to test it, lack of suitable substrates for establishment may partly
explain the limited range shift of *B. alleghaniensis*. Several studies
suggested that microsite variables and competing vegetation may greatly limit
recruitment of *B. alleghaniensis*, which preferentially colonises coarse till,
decayed logs and bare soil [@caspersen_seedling_2005;
@drobyshev_environmental_2014].

### Physical variables

Local topographic and edaphic characteristics also largely influenced the
probability of sapling presence, but less so their abundance. At their northern
margins, lowlands with poor soil drainage could represent a substantial
impediment to temperate tree migration. @lafleur_response_2010 had previously
suggested that soil factors should not represent a major constraint for species
northward shift except in waterlogged conditions which could prevent or slow
down tree migration. All four species generally prefer mesic well-drained soils
and only *A. rubrum* is known to tolerate poor soil drainage
[@burns_silvics_1990; @niinemets_tolerance_2006]. Waterlogged conditions affect
oxygen and nutrient availability [@st_clair_key_2008] and could thus reduce
seedling and sapling survival. Species tolerance to unfavourable soil conditions
could also decrease at their northern range margins where they are already under
temperature stress. Similar changes in tolerance were found for *Abies balsamea*
at the boundary between mixedwood and coniferous forests where its preference
for mesic soils was stronger closer to its northern margin
[@messaoud_ecological_2007]. Moreover, as discussed above, a warmer microclimate
associated to cold air drainage could further contribute to the preference of
saplings for mesic uplands.

Acidic soils were favourable for the presence of *B. alleghaniensis* saplings,
while basic soils were favourable for *A. saccharum* and unfavourable for *F.
grandifolia*. Although the presence of *A. rubrum* was not affected by soil pH,
its abundance was greater on basic soils. Such species-specific preferences for
soil pH have been previously reported and are associated with variations in
nutrient availability, such as calcium [@kobe_tree_2002; @st_clair_key_2008]. As
supported here, seedlings of *A. saccharum*, prefers alkaline calcium-rich soils
[@drf_expansion_2017; @kobe_tree_2002; @st_clair_key_2008], whereas *F.
grandifolia* grows poorly, little or not at all on calcareous or alkaline soils
[@drf_expansion_2017]. *B. alleghaniensis* and *A. rubrum* are generally
considered tolerant to a wide range of pH [@kobe_tree_2002]. Decreasing soil
calcium levels in northeastern America, in part due to high atmospheric acid
depositions, has been associated with the decline in regeneration and growth of
*A. saccharum* and the concomitant expansion of *F. grandifolia*
[@bal_nutrient_2015]. Such a phenomenon could contribute to the changes in
occurrence patterns we observed for the two species in the southern portion of
Québec. Although *A. saccharum* and *A. rubrum* preferred high soil pH, we did
not find significant negative effects of low soil pH. And the recruitment of *B.
alleghaniensis* was even favoured by low soil pH. Therefore, acid soils common
in northern mixed and boreal forests might not be a major barrier to their
recruitment and allowed their northward migration.



### Disturbance

Recruitment of all species was generally favoured by moderate logging, while the
effect of natural disturbances (here mostly insect outbreak and windfall, Fig.
\ref{figC.1}) was mainly negative (except for *A. rubrum*, for which the effect
was positive). In contrast, major logging decreased the probability of finding
at least one recruit (except for *A. rubrum*), but, when there was successful
recruitment, the number of recruits was high for all species. This corroborates
the results of other studies showing larger recruitments of temperate species in
canopy gaps near their northern margins [@kneeshaw_natural_2007;
@leithead_northward_2010; @zhang_stand_2015]. Indeed, many tree species of
various shade tolerances can exhibit pulsed recruitment patterns following
discrete disturbance events [@bouchard_tree_2006]. Furthermore, compared to
natural disturbance regime, logging has been shown to favour the increases in
temperate tree proportion in mixed forests [@boucher_logging_2009]. As logging
is a selective disturbance that primarily affects *Abies balsamea* in the study
area [@brice_moderate_2020; @duchesne_population_2008], partial logging may give
a competitive advantage to sapling recruitment of the co-occurring temperate
species. Moreover, logging can promote strong vegetative reproduction of
temperate species [@fei_rapid_2009]. The effects of natural disturbances on tree
regeneration may differ from that of logging. The main natural disturbances in
the study area are insect outbreaks caused by the spruce budworm which also
predominantly attacks *A. balsamea*. Thanks to an extensive seedling bank, *A.
balsamea* can recruit abundantly after an outbreak [@morin_dynamics_1994]. In
contrast, the machinery used for logging could cause damage to the seedling
bank.     

In our study, recruitment of *A. rubrum* benefited the most from all types of
disturbance events (logging and natural) and was favoured in young forests. This
species' capacity to regenerate abundantly after disturbances and remain
dominant in the canopy is thought to explain its widespread increase across
eastern North America [@abrams_red_1998; @fei_rapid_2009;
@tremblay_potential_2002]. Moreover, *A. rubrum* can thrive after logging, which
promotes strong vegetative regeneration from stump sprouts [@fei_rapid_2009;
@tremblay_potential_2002].

The observed range shifts of *A. rubrum* and *A. saccharum* may also be partly
ascribed to historical disturbances. Expansion of *Acer* species has been
documented for all of northeastern North America since preindustrial times
[@danneyrolles_anthropogenic_2018; @terrail_reorganization_2019;
@thompson_four_2013]. Their success has been attributed to their ability to
thrive in a wide range of soil and light conditions combined with their abundant
and efficient regeneration which allows them to quickly colonise recently
disturbed sites [@barras_supply_1998; @fei_rapid_2009; @nolet_successional_2008;
@zhang_stand_2015]. As such, it is very likely that in our study area *A.
saccharum* and particularly *A. rubrum* benefited from both recent and
historical human disturbances. Furthermore, both *Acer* species may be
continuing their expansion driven by the extensive human disturbances that took
place since preindustrial times; thus, their current northern distribution
limits may not be at equilibrium with the current climate.

Contrary to our expectations and that of others [@johnstone_changing_2016;
@renwick_temporal_2015], the positive effect of moderate logging on recruitment
did not translate into larger northward range shifts; the shifts observed here
were either similar (*Acer spp.*) or reduced (*B. alleghaniensis*) in disturbed
forests. In light of these results, we hypothesise that disturbances may not
displace range limits *per se* because of other limiting factors, mainly
dependence on conspecific trees for dispersal, priority effect from boreal trees
and edaphic conditions. Yet, they could promote recruitment in already occupied
sites, thus increasing their relative proportion, as well as in new sites in the
neighbourhood and downslope thus increasing their occupancy at their northern
range margins, but not beyond.


### Climate

Climate has a determinant role in forest dynamics and in constraining species
range, and thus we expected to find a larger direct influence of climatic
variables on sapling recruitment at the species northern limits. Temperature of
the growing season had a positive effect on all species. Consequently, we would
expect an overall positive effect of climate warming, but its effect varied
widely across species. Climate warming had a positive influence on the presence
of *B. alleghaniensis* and the abundance of *A. rubrum*, but a negative effect
on the presence of *F. grandifolia* and *A. saccharum* was not affected at all.
These disparate signals are consistent with previous work that concluded that
the range limits of these four temperate species are not directly controlled by
their climatic tolerances, but by fecundity, soil factors or disturbances
[@drobyshev_environmental_2014; @graignic_geographical_2014;
@tremblay_potential_2002; @zhang_stand_2015]. These non-climatic and local
drivers may modulate or mask any broad-scale climatic effects
[@drobyshev_environmental_2014; @serra-diaz_disturbance_2015; @zhang_stand_2015]
and transform a unidirectional signal of regeneration shift into a more complex
set of signals with localised areas of relatively high regeneration. Time lags
in tree responses may also explain why range shifts are poorly correlated with
the warming trends [@sittaro_tree_2017]. Besides, climate extremes, such as
droughts and heat waves, as well as variations in early- and late-season
climate, may be more important for several tree life cycle events than gradual
changes in mean climate conditions [@boisvertmarsh_divergent_2019;
@neumann_climate_2017].


# Conclusions

Tree sapling recruitment is an important process in forest ecosystems. The rate
and magnitude of tree range shifts under climate warming will likely depend
strongly upon successful tree recruitment at range limits. Integrating tree
demographic processes is therefore fundamental for accurately forecasting
species range shifts and adapting management strategies, but this will likely be
challenging as there is not a single broad‐scale response of recruitment
dynamics. Saplings of three out of four temperate species experienced northward
range shifts in the last decades. However, disturbances may sometimes impede
these shifts, as we observed for *B. alleghaniensis*, and they should therefore
be taken into account in future studies on range shifts. Moreover, downslope
trends in sapling distributions at their northern margins may indicate the onset
of an expansion from marginal populations found on hilltops. Overall, our
findings suggest that tree recruitment was only weakly related to broad‐scale
climate change and was instead controlled by local factors and disturbances.
Although moderate disturbances may promote episodic recruitment pulses of
temperate species at their northern margins, they did not catalyse larger
northward shifts likely because sapling recruitment was constrained by their
dependence on conspecific trees for dispersal, the inhibitory priority effect of
boreal cover, as well as the unsuitability of lowland hydric soils.
