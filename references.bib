  abstract = {Diversity-biomass relationships are frequently reported to be hump-shaped over space at a given time. However, it is not yet clear how diversity and biomass change simultaneously and how they are related to each other over time (e.g. in succession) at one locality. This study develops a temporal model based on the projected changes of various community variables in a generalized terrestrial environment after fire and uses post-fire succession data on Santa Monica Mountains of southern California and other published succession data to examine the temporal diversitybiomass relationships. The results indicate that in the early stages of succession, both diversity and biomass increase and a positive relationship appears, while in the late stages of succession, biomass continued to increase but diversity usually declines; thus a negative relationship may be observed. When the scales of measurement become sufficiently large so that the measured diversity and biomass cross various stages of succession, a `hump-shaped' relationship can emerge. The diversity-biomass relationship appears to be concordant in space and time when appropriate scales are used. Formerly proposed explanations for spatial patterns may well apply to the temporal patterns (particularly colonization, facilitation and competitive exclusion).},

At a landscape scale, these impacts, and biotic responses such as adaptation and migration, will be mediated by spatial heterogeneity in climate and climate change. We examine several aspects of the geography of climate change and their significance for biodiversity conservation. Location California and Nevada, USA. Methods Using current climate surfaces (PRISM) and two scenarios of future climate (A1b, 2070\textendash{}2099, warmer-drier and warmer-wetter), we mapped disappearing, declining, expanding and novel climates, and the velocity and direction of climate change in California and Nevada. We also examined fine-scale spatial heterogeneity in protected areas of the San Francisco Bay Area in relation to reserve size, topographic complexity and distance from the ocean. Results Under the two climate change scenarios, current climates across most of California and Nevada will shrink greatly in extent, and the climates of the highest peaks will disappear from this region. Expanding and novel climates are projected for the Central Valley. Current temperature isoclines are projected to move up to 4.9 km year-1 in flatter regions, but substantially slower in mountainous areas because of steep local topoclimate gradients. In the San Francisco Bay Area, climate diversity within currently protected areas increases with reserve size and proximity to the ocean (the latter because of strong coastal climate gradients). However, by 2100 of almost 500 protected areas ({$>$}100 ha), only eight of the largest are projected to experience temperatures within their currently observed range. Topoclimate variability will further increase the range of conditions experienced and needs to be incorporated in future analyses. Main Conclusions Spatial heterogeneity in climate, from mesoclimate to topoclimate scales, represents an important spatial buffer in response to climate change, and merits increased attention in conservation planning.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models predict a wholesale redistribution of trees in the next century, yet migratory responses necessary to spatially track climates far exceed maximum post-glacial rates. The extent to which populations will adapt will depend upon phenotypic variation, strength of selection, fecundity, interspecific competition, and biotic interactions. Populations of temperate and boreal trees show moderate to strong clines in phenology and growth along temperature gradients, indicating substantial local adaptation. Traits involved in local adaptation appear to be the product of small effects of many genes, and the resulting genotypic redundancy combined with high fecundity may facilitate rapid local adaptation despite high gene flow. Gene flow with preadapted alleles from warmer climates may promote adaptation and migration at the leading edge, while populations at the rear will likely face extirpation. Widespread species with large populations and high fecundity are likely to persist and adapt, but will likely suffer adaptational lag for a few generations. As all tree species will be suffering lags, interspecific competition may weaken, facilitating persistence under suboptimal conditions. Species with small populations, fragmented ranges, low fecundity, or suffering declines due to introduced insects or diseases should be candidates for facilitated migration.},

  abstract = {Gap analysis is a protocol for assessing the extent to which valued biodiversity attributes are represented within protected areas. Such analysis involves overlaying the distribution of biodiversity features (e.g. species) with protected areas, but the protocol entails arbitrary assumptions that affect the outcome of the assessments. In particular, since species' distributions are usually mapped at a coarser resolution than protected areas, rules have to be defined to match the two data layers. Typically, a grid cell is considered protected if a given proportion is covered by protected areas. Because the effectiveness of protected areas is dependent on the definition of such arbitrary proportions (i.e., thresholds), errors of commission and omission in the level of species' representation are bound to exist. We propose an alternative approach whereby the contribution of a cell for the representation of species is defined as the expected value of a hyper-geometric random variable. We compare the conventional approach based on fixed thresholds with this new probability-based approach for both static and dynamic conservation scenarios, using a virtual dataset and a 100-plant-species' dataset for Iberian Peninsula. Results support the view that traditional fixed thresholds yield inconsistent results. Because species present different distributional patterns coinciding differently with protected areas, species-specific and time-specific thresholds should be used. Our approach enables to easily obtain these more adequate threshold values, thus offering a promising method for gap analyses. Future studies should seek to evaluate the performance of this method empirically in different conservation planning contexts.},

However, the consequences of such changes on community structure are still poorly understood, particularly the impacts on food-web properties. Here, we propose a new framework, coupling species distribution and trophic models, to predict climate change impacts on food-web structure across the Mediterranean Sea. Sea surface temperature was used to determine the fish climate niches and their future distributions. Body size was used to infer trophic interactions between fish species. Our projections reveal that 54 fish species of 256 endemic and native species included in our analysis would disappear by 2080\textendash{}2099 from the Mediterranean continental shelf. The number of feeding links between fish species would decrease on 73.4\% of the continental shelf. However, the connectance of the overall fish web would increase on average, from 0.26 to 0.29, mainly due to a differential loss rate of feeding links and species richness. This result masks a systematic decrease in predator generality, estimated here as the number of prey species, from 30.0 to 25.4. Therefore, our study highlights large-scale impacts of climate change on marine food-web structure with potential deep consequences on ecosystem functioning. However, these impacts will likely be highly heterogeneous in space, challenging our current understanding of climate change impact on local marine ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Abstract Mountain forests are at particular risk of climate change impacts due to their temperature limitation and high exposure to warming. At the same time, their complex topography may help to buffer the effects of climate change and create climate refugia. Whether climate change can lead to critical transitions of mountain forest ecosystems and whether such transitions are reversible remains incompletely understood. We investigated the resilience of forest composition and size structure to climate change, focusing on a mountain forest landscape in the Eastern Alps. Using the individual-based forest landscape model iLand we simulated ecosystem responses to a wide range of climatic changes (up to a 6\textdegree{}C increase in mean annual temperature and a 30 \% reduction in mean annual precipitation), testing for tipping points in vegetation size structure and composition under different topography scenarios. We found that at warming levels above +2\textdegree{}C a threshold was crossed, with the system tipping into an alternative state. The system shifted from a conifer-dominated landscape characterized by large trees to a landscape dominated by smaller, predominantly broadleaved trees. Topographic complexity moderated climate change impacts, smoothing and delaying the transitions between alternative vegetation states. We subsequently reversed the simulated climate forcing to assess the ability of the landscape to recover from climate change impacts. The forest landscape showed hysteresis, particularly in scenarios with lower precipitation. At the same mean annual temperature, equilibrium vegetation size structure and species composition differed between warming and cooling trajectories. Here we show that even moderate warming corresponding to current policy targets could result in critical transitions of forest ecosystems and highlight the importance of topographic complexity as a buffering agent. Furthermore, our results show that overshooting ambitious climate mitigation targets could be dangerous, as ecological impacts can be irreversible at millennial time scales once a tipping point has been crossed.},

However, forecasts from statistical models (e.g. species distribution models) rarely consider that plant community changes could substantially lag behind climatic changes, hindering our ability to make temporally realistic projections for the coming century. Indeed, the magnitudes of lags, and the relative importance of the different factors giving rise to them, remain poorly understood. We review evidence for three types of lag: ``dispersal lags'' affecting plant species' spread along elevational gradients, ``establishment lags'' following their arrival in recipient communities, and ``extinction lags'' of resident species. Variation in lags is explained by variation among species in physiological and demographic responses, by effects of altered biotic interactions, and by aspects of the physical environment. Of these, altered biotic interactions could contribute substantially to establishment and extinction lags, yet impacts of biotic interactions on range dynamics are poorly understood. We develop a mechanistic community model to illustrate how species turnover in future communities might lag behind simple expectations based on species' range shifts with unlimited dispersal. The model shows a combined contribution of altered biotic interactions and dispersal lags to plant community turnover along an elevational gradient following climate warming. Our review and simulation support the view that accounting for disequilibrium range dynamics will be essential for realistic forecasts of patterns of biodiversity under climate change, with implications for the conservation of mountain species and the ecosystem functions they provide.},

  abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions have significantly altered global climate, and will continue to do so in the future. Increases in the frequency, duration, and/or severity of drought and heat stress associated with climate change could fundamentally alter the composition, structure, and biogeography of forests in many regions. Of particular concern are potential increases in tree mortality associated with climateinduced physiological stress and interactions with other climate-mediated processes such as insect outbreaks and wildfire. Despite this risk, existing projections of tree mortality are based on models that lack functionally realistic mortality mechanisms, and there has been no attempt to track observations of climate-driven tree mortality globally. Here we present the first global assessment of recent tree mortality attributed to drought and heat stress. Although episodic mortality occurs in the absence of climate change, studies compiled here suggest that at least some of the world's forested ecosystems already may be responding to climate change and raise concern that forests may become increasingly vulnerable to higher background tree mortality rates and die-off in response to future warming and drought, even in environments that are not normally considered water-limited. This further suggests risks to ecosystem services, including the loss of sequestered forest carbon and associated atmospheric feedbacks. Our review also identifies key information gaps and scientific uncertainties that currently hinder our ability to predict tree mortality in response to climate change and emphasizes the need for a globally coordinated observation system. Overall, our review reveals the potential for amplified tree mortality due to drought and heat in forests worldwide.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem patterns and disturbance processes at one spatial scale often interact with processes at another scale, and the result of such cross-scale interactions can be nonlinear dynamics with thresholds. Examples of cross-scale pattern-process relationships and interactions among forest dieback, fire, and erosion are illustrated from northern New Mexico (USA) landscapes, where long-term studies have recently documented all of these disturbance processes. For example, environmental stress, operating on individual trees, can cause tree death that is amplified by insect mortality agents to propagate to patch and then landscape or even regional-scale forest dieback. Severe drought and unusual warmth in the southwestern USA since the late 1990s apparently exceeded species-specific physiological thresholds for multiple tree species, resulting in substantial vegetation mortality across millions of hectares of woodlands and forests in recent years. Predictions of forest dieback across spatial scales are constrained by uncertainties associated with: limited knowledge of species-specific physiological thresholds; individual and site-specific variation in these mortality thresholds; and positive feedback loops between rapidly-responding insect herbivore populations and their stressed plant hosts, sometimes resulting in nonlinear ``pest'' outbreak dynamics. Fire behavior also exhibits nonlinearities across spatial scales, illustrated by changes in historic fire regimes where patch-scale grazing disturbance led to regional-scale collapse of surface fire activity and subsequent recent increases in the scale of extreme fire events in New Mexico. Vegetation dieback interacts with fire activity by modifying fuel amounts and configurations at multiple spatial scales. Runoff and erosion processes are also subject to scale-dependent threshold behaviors, exemplified by ecohydrological work in semiarid New Mexico watersheds showing how declines in ground surface cover lead to non-linear increases in bare patch connectivity and thereby accelerated runoff and erosion at hillslope and watershed scales. Vegetation dieback, grazing, and fire can change land surface properties and cross-scale hydrologic connectivities, directly altering ecohydrological patterns of runoff and erosion. The interactions among disturbance processes across spatial scales can be key drivers in ecosystem dynamics, as illustrated by these studies of recent landscape changes in northern New Mexico. To better anticipate and mitigate accelerating human impacts to the planetary ecosystem at all spatial scales, improvements are needed in our conceptual and quantitative understanding of cross-scale interactions among disturbance processes.},

Consequences of species losses such as secondary extinctions are difficult to forecast because species are not isolated, but interact instead in a complex network of ecological relationships. Because of their mutual dependence, the loss of a single species can cascade in multiple coextinctions. Here we show that an algorithm adapted from the one Google uses to rank web-pages can order species according to their importance for coextinctions, providing the sequence of losses that results in the fastest collapse of the network. Moreover, we use the algorithm to bridge the gap between qualitative (who eats whom) and quantitative (at what rate) descriptions of food webs. We show that our simple algorithm finds the best possible solution for the problem of assigning importance from the perspective of secondary extinctions in all analyzed networks. Our approach relies on network structure, but applies regardless of the specific dynamical model of species' interactions, because it identifies the subset of coextinctions common to all possible models, those that will happen with certainty given the complete loss of prey of a given predator. Results show that previous measures of importance based on the concept of ``hubs'' or number of connections, as well as centrality measures, do not identify the most effective extinction sequence. The proposed algorithm provides a basis for further developments in the analysis of extinction risk in ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Forest mortality constitutes a major uncertainty in projections of climate impacts on terrestrial ecosystems and carbon-cycle feedbacks. Recent drought-induced, widespread forest die-offs highlight that climate change could accelerate forest mortality with its diverse and potentially severe consequences for the global carbon cycle, ecosystem services, and biodiversity. How trees die during drought over multiple years remains largely unknown and precludes mechanistic modeling and prediction of forest die-off with climate change. Here, we examine the physiological basis of a recent multiyear widespread die-off of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) across much of western North America. Using observations from both native trees while they are dying and a rainfall exclusion experiment on mature trees, we measure hydraulic performance over multiple seasons and years and assess pathways of accumulated hydraulic damage. We test whether accumulated hydraulic damage can predict the probability of tree survival over 2 years. We find that hydraulic damage persisted and increased in dying trees over multiple years and exhibited few signs of repair. This accumulated hydraulic deterioration is largely mediated by increased vulnerability to cavitation, a process known as cavitation fatigue. Furthermore, this hydraulic damage predicts the probability of interyear stem mortality. Contrary to the expectation that surviving trees have weathered severe drought, the hydraulic deterioration demonstrated here reveals that surviving regions of these forests are actually more vulnerable to future droughts due to accumulated xylem damage. As the most widespread tree species in North America, increasing vulnerability to drought in these forests has important ramifications for ecosystem stability, biodiversity, and ecosystem carbon balance. Our results provide a foundation for incorporating accumulated drought impacts into climate\textendash{}vegetation models. Finally, our findings highlight the critical role of drought stress accumulation and repair of stress-induced damage for avoiding plant mortality, presenting a dynamic and contingent framework for drought impacts on forest ecosystems.},

However, forestry also influences land-surface properties, including albedo (the fraction of incident sunlight reflected back to space), surface roughness, and evapotranspiration, all of which affect the amount and forms of energy transfer to the atmosphere. In some circumstances, these biophysical feedbacks can result in local climate warming, thereby counteracting the effects of carbon sequestration on global mean temperature and reducing or eliminating the net value of climate-change mitigation projects. Here, we review published and emerging research that suggests ways in which forestry projects can counteract the consequences associated with biophysical interactions, and highlight knowledge gaps in managing forests for climate protection. We also outline several ways in which biophysical effects can be incorporated into frameworks that use the maintenance of forests as a climate protection strategy.},

  abstract = {The traditional likelihood-based test for differences in multivariate dispersions is known to be sensitive to nonnormality. It is also impossible to use when the number of variables exceeds the number of observations. Many biological and ecological data sets have many variables, are highly skewed, and are zero-inflated. The traditional test and even some more robust alternatives are also unreasonable in many contexts where measures of dispersion based on a non-Euclidean dissimilarity would be more appropriate. Distance-based tests of homogeneity of multivariate dispersions, which can be based on any dissimilarity measure of choice, are proposed here. They rely on the rotational invariance of either the multivariate centroid or the spatial median to obtain measures of spread using principal coordinate axes. The tests are straightforward multivariate extensions of Levene's test, with P-values obtained either using the traditional F-distribution or using permutation of either least-squares or LAD residuals. Examples illustrate the utility of the approach, including the analysis of stabilizing selection in sparrows, biodiversity of New Zealand fish assemblages, and the response of Indonesian reef corals to an El Ni{\~n}o. Monte Carlo simulations from the real data sets show that the distance-based tests are robust and powerful for relevant alternative hypotheses of real differences in spread.},

However, their utility can be greatly compromised by the existence of glacial refugia that are undetectable in fossil records (cryptic refugia). Despite several decades of investigation, it remains controversial whether Beringia, the largely unglaciated area extending from northeastern Siberia to the Yukon Territory, harbored small populations of certain boreal tree species during the last glaciation. Here, we present genetic evidence for the existence of a glacial refuge in Alaska that helps to resolve this long-standing controversy. We sequenced chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) of white spruce (Picea glauca), a dominant boreal tree species, in 24 forest stands across northwestern North America. The majority of cpDNA haplotypes are unique, and haplotype diversity is relatively high in Alaska, arguing against the possibility that this species migrated into the region from areas south of the Laurentide Ice Sheet after the end of the last glaciation. Thus, white spruce apparently survived long glacial episodes under climatic extremes in a heterogeneous landscape matrix. These results suggest that estimated rates of tree migration from fossil records may be too high and that the ability of trees to track anthropogenic warming may be more limited than previously thought.},

Differences in beta diversity among different areas or groups of samples can be tested using this approach. The choice of transformation and dissimilarity measure has important consequences for interpreting results. For kelp holdfast assemblages from New Zealand, variation in species composition was greater in smaller holdfasts, while variation in relative abundances was greater in larger holdasts. Variation in community structure of Norwegian continental shelf macrobenthic fauna increased with increases in environmental heterogeneity, regardless of the measure used. We propose a new dissimilarity measure which allows the relative weight placed on changes in composition vs. abundance to be specified explicitly.},

Climate change may alter forest recovery dynamics or even prevent recovery, triggering feedbacks to the climate system, altering regional biodiversity, and affecting the ecosystem services provided by forests. Multiple lines of evidence \textendash{} including global-scale patterns in forest recovery dynamics; forest responses to experimental manipulation of CO2, temperature, and precipitation; forest responses to the climate change that has already occurred; ecological theory; and ecosystem and earth system models \textendash{} all indicate that the dynamics of forest recovery are sensitive to climate. However, synthetic understanding of how atmospheric CO2 and climate shape trajectories of forest recovery is lacking. Here, we review these separate lines of evidence, which together demonstrate that the dynamics of forest recovery are being impacted by increasing atmospheric CO2 and changing climate. Rates of forest recovery generally increase with CO2, temperature, and water availability. Drought reduces growth and live biomass in forests of all ages, having a particularly strong effect on seedling recruitment and survival. Responses of individual trees and whole-forest ecosystems to CO2 and climate manipulations often vary by age, implying that forests of different ages will respond differently to climate change. Furthermore, species within a community typically exhibit differential responses to CO2 and climate, and altered community dynamics can have important consequences for ecosystem function. Age- and species-dependent responses provide a mechanism by which climate change may push some forests past critical thresholds such that they fail to recover to their previous state following disturbance. Altered dynamics of forest recovery will result in positive and negative feedbacks to climate change. Future research on this topic and corresponding improvements to earth system models will be a key to understanding the future of forests and their feedbacks to the climate system.},

  abstract = {Single-tree selection cutting is sometimes believed to be similar to the natural gap disturbance regime of hardwood forests, but few studies have specifically compared the compositional and structural characteristics of old-growth hardwood stands, undergoing natural gap dynamics and hardwood stands previously subjected to partial cuts. This study characterized and compared the composition (saplings and trees) and structure (gaps, foliage distribution, tree diameter and density, snags and coarse woody debris) of old-growth stands (OG), 12-year-old selection cuts (SC), and 28\textendash{}33-year-old diameter-limit cuts (DLC) in sugar maple (Acer saccharum)-dominated northern hardwood stands. Results showed marked structural differences between OG and harvested stands, with stronger differences between DLC and OG than between SC and OG. The synchronized formation of numerous canopy openings in harvested stands induced a massive post-harvest recruitment of advance regeneration in both SC and DLC that created a dense foliage layer in the understory. Large living trees (dbh{$>$}39.1cm) and defective trees were less numerous in SC than OG, which can have a detrimental impact on species dependent on these structural elements, and on the future availability and characteristics of coarse woody debris. Relatively few compositional differences were noticed among stand types, although a greater proportion of mid-tolerant species was found in the post-harvest recruitment cohorts of harvested stands compared to OG, and a lower proportion of beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) saplings was observed in DLC compared to OG and SC. We argue that even if selection cutting is closer to the natural disturbance regime of hardwood forests than diameter-limit cutting, and therefore representing progress toward the development and implementation of a natural-disturbance-based management, a recurring application of selection cutting might lead to a homogenization of forest structure and composition, a reduction of key structural features and a reduction in biological diversity at both the stand and landscape scales. Some management recommendations are proposed.},

Understanding species{\~O} abilities to shift ranges has important implications for assessing extinction risk and predicting future community structure. At an expanding front, colonization rates are determined jointly by rates of reproduction and dispersal. In addition, establishment of viable populations requires that individuals find suitable resources in novel habitats. Thus, species with greater dispersal ability, reproductive rate and ecological generalization should be more likely to expand into new regions under climate change. Here, we assess current evidence for the relationship between leading-edge range shifts and species{\~O} traits. We found expected relationships for several datasets, including diet breadth in North American Passeriformes and egg-laying habitat in British Odonata. However, models generally had low explanatory power. Thus, even statistically and biologically meaningful relationships are unlikely to be of predictive utility for conservation and management. Trait-based range shift forecasts face several challenges, including quantifying relevant natural history variation across large numbers of species and coupling these data with extrinsic factors such as habitat fragmentation and availability.},

The range of expected representation of species in reserves would vary from a minimum of 30\% for bryophytes to a maximum of 63\% for angiosperms. Current reserve networks would always represent fewer angiosperms than expected by chance; depending on the rules, more or fewer bryophytes than expected by chance; and slightly more, or just as many, pteridophytes as expected by chance.

The framework includes three steps: (1) \textregistered{}t models explaining current occurrence of species; (2) transform current probabilities of occurrence into estimates of persistence using available information on expected threats and species' vulnerability; and (3) select complementary areas to ensure high estimates of persistence for each species. This paper provides an example using coarse-scale data for European trees, without threat data. Three approaches for modelling species probabilities of occurrence are compared: \textregistered{}rst, by considering occurrence in relation to environmental variation; second, by considering occurrence in relation to patterns of geographical aggregation or contagion among records; and third, by combining these two components. The third model \textregistered{}ts the original data most closely, but \textregistered{}eld assessments of persistence estimates are needed. As expected, introducing additional constraints into area selection reduces the \textasciimacron{}exibility (fewer alternative sets of areas) and increases the cost (more areas needed to achieve the goal). However, the proposed method increases the overall expected probability of persistence for the species. This bene\textregistered{}t is greatest among the species with the most restricted ranges, which are the species of greatest conservation concern. \# 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Once bioclimatic envelopes are characterized, they can be applied to a variety of questions in ecology, evolution, and conservation. However, some have questioned the usefulness of these models, because they may be based on implausible assumptions or may be contradicted by empirical evidence. We review these areas of contention, and suggest that criticism has often been misplaced, resulting from confusion between what the models actually deliver and what users wish that they would express. Although improvements in data and methods will have some effect, the usefulness of these models is contingent on their appropriate use, and they will improve mainly via better awareness of their conceptual basis, strengths, and limitations.},

Winter logging operations were conducted between 1942 and 1949, and summer logging operations were conducted between 1958 and 1960. The interaction between cuttings and the 1950s and 1970s spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana (Clemens)) outbreaks that occurred in the area affected forest dynamics. For the two logging operation types, the most abundant softwood species observed before logging and in 2003 was balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.), whereas white birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.) were the most abundant hardwood species. Changes in the overstory composition were more significant in the summer logging operations than in the winter ones. The softwood cover type observed before winter logging was maintained in 2003. Following summer logging, an important increase in the proportion of birch species was observed. The softwood cover type observed before logging had changed to a mixedwood cover type by 2003. Forest dynamics differences between the two types of logging were the result of interactions between the density and composition of advance regeneration, the microsite conditions after logging, and the length and severity of spruce budworm outbreaks.},

We ask whether present intraspecific diversity is determined by the imprint of past climate. This is an ongoing debate requiring interdisciplinary examination of population genetic pools and persistence patterns across global ranges. Previously, contrasting inferences and predictions have resulted from distinct genomic coverage and/or geographical information. We aim to describe and explain the causes of geographical contrasts in genetic diversity and their consequences for the future baseline of the global genetic pool, by comparing present geographical distribution of genetic diversity and differentiation with predictive species distribution modelling (SDM) during past extremes, present time and future climate scenarios for a brown alga, Fucus vesiculosus. SDM showed that both atmospheric and oceanic variables shape the global distribution of intertidal species, revealing regions of persistence, extinction and expansion during glacial and postglacial periods. These explained the distribution and structure of present genetic diversity, consisting of differentiated genetic pools with maximal diversity in areas of long-term persistence. Most of the present species range comprises postglacial expansion zones and, in contrast to highly dispersive marine organisms, expansions involved only local fronts, leaving distinct genetic pools at rear edges. Besides unravelling a complex phylogeographical history and showing congruence between genetic diversity and persistent distribution zones, supporting the hypothesis of niche conservatism, range shifts and loss of unique genetic diversity at the rear edge were predicted for future climate scenarios, impoverishing the global gene pool.},

  abstract = {The extensive literature on natural disturbance in forests is reviewed in terms of the hypotheses: (1) that disturbance is a major force moulding the development, structure and function of forests; and (b) that management of forests for all their benefits can be controlled so that the effects can be contained within those which result from natural disturbance. The causal factors of natural disturbance are both endogenous and exogenous; there are major difficulties in the formal characterization of disturbance and of recovery after disturbance. As to the latter, the acceptance of classical generalizations of the nature of succession has led to particular difficulties in the assessment and interpretation of recovery. Tree fall, which creates gaps, is fundamental to the development of many forests, and has been most intensively studied in tropical forests of Central America and the Amazon and in temperate forests of North America. Tree fall is part of autogenic change; mechanisms of gap-filling and subsequent growth and species composition vary widely with forest type and geography. Disturbance by wind is particularly difficult to characterize. Wind varies along a continuum; the blow-down of an individual tree may be mostly due to autogenic processes of ageing and decay, whereas catastrophic hurricanes and cyclones may be defined as wholly exogenous. Nevertheless, the resilience in terms of species diversity of tropical forests following catastrophic disturbance by hurricane is remarkable. A number of studies support the view that the tropical forest in hurricane-prone areas is not a stable steady-state ecosystem but rather that heterogeneity is maintained by catastrophe. The ability to regenerate by suckers and the coincidence of regenerative space and gregarious flowering are important components of the response of rainforest following disturbance. For much of the world, `fire is the dominant fact of forest history'. As examples, fire and its effects are reviewed for the northern boreal forests, oak-pine forests and north-western sub-alpine forests of North America. The effect of fire on species composition varies with intensity and frequency. That, together with the popular view of fire as unnatural and therefore unacceptable, places great demands on management of forests for all of their benefits, including national parks and reserves. These difficulties also affect management of other ecosystems, such as Mediterranean-type shrublands and heathlands where species diversity, productivity and cycles of regeneration and degradation are governed by fire as a natural disturbance. Shifting agriculture is a traditional form of agriculture used by at least 240 million people in the humid tropics. Shifting agriculture, together with wind, lightning and fire, is an exogenous disturbance which has little effect on soil fertility and on structure and composition of the rainforest which re-establishes after abandonment. As the intensity of disturbance of rainforest increases, resilience of the forest decreases and the current problems of extensive clearing for improved pasture and of uncontrolled logging are resulting in degraded ecosystems. Regeneration follows the often extensive death of trees caused by outbreaks of insects in many coniferous forests of northern America. This disturbance by herbivory halts increasing stagnation (as measured by decreasing rates of ecosystem production and nutrient cycling) and reinitiates succession. Other disturbances to forests occur through damage from ice-storms, snow avalanches, erosional and earthquake landslides, and volcanic activity; the development of Nothofagus forests in Chile and New Zealand is determined by such catastrophic mass movements. An extensive literature supports the hypothesis that natural disturbance is fundamental to the development of structure and function of forest ecosystems. It follows that our management of natural forest should be based on an ecological understanding of the processes of natural disturbance. Whether or not we want to do this, and the extent to which we want to derive all of the benefits from the forest, including timber, depends on social attitudes. Whereas humanism may treat conservation as the wise husbanding of forests in the interests of social traditions and harmony, animism may give nature unalienable rights. The conclusion from this review is that the ecological framework of natural disturbance and the knowledge of its component processes and effects provides the basis on which we can manage our forests as a renewable resource which can be utilized so that the forests `retain their diversity and richness for mankind's continuing benefit'. Nowhere is this management more desperately needed than for the protection of the world's tropical forests, its peoples and their cultures.},

  abstract = {The integration of functional traits into vulnerability assessments is a promising approach to quantitatively capture differences in species sensitivity and adaptive capacity to climate change, allowing the refinement of tree species distribution models. In response to a clear need to identify traits that are responsive to climate change and applicable in a management context, we review the state of knowledge of the main mechanisms, and their associated traits, that underpin the ability of boreal and temperate tree species to persist and (or) shift their distribution in a changing climate. We aimed to determine whether current knowledge is sufficiently mature and available to be used effectively in vulnerability assessments. Marshalling recent conceptual advances and assessing data availability, our ultimate objective is to guide modellers and practitioners in finding and selecting sets of traits that can be used to capture differences in species' ability to persist and migrate. While the physiological mechanisms that determine sensitivity to climate change are relatively well understood (e.g., drought-induced cavitation), many associated traits have not been systematically documented for North American trees and differences in methodology preclude their widespread integration into vulnerability assessments (e.g., xylem recovery capacity). In contrast, traits traditionally associated with the ability to migrate and withstand fire are generally well documented, but new key traits are emerging in the context of climate change that have not been as well characterized (e.g., age of optimum seed production). More generally, lack of knowledge surrounding the extent and patterns in intraspecific trait variation, as well as co-variation and interaction among traits, limit our ability to use this approach to assess tree adaptive capacity. We conclude by outlining research needs and potential strategies for the development of trait-based knowledge applicable in large-scale modelling efforts, sketching out important aspects of trait data organization that should be part of a coordinated effort by the forest science community.},

  abstract = {Projected changes in climate conditions vary widely across Canada's 350 M ha of forests, and so does the capacity of forest species to cope with these changes (sensitivity). Development and prioritization of adaptation strategies for sustainable forest management will depend on integrated assessments of relative stand vulnerability. We developed species-specific indices of sensitivity to (1) drought-induced mortality and (2) migration failure, based on traits for 22 of the most abundant tree species in Canada. By combining this information with stand composition data and spatially explicit climate change projections, we were able to map Canadian forest vulnerability to drought and migration failure. Our maps show forest vulnerability changing rapidly under a high carbon emission scenario (RCP 8.5) between short(2011\textendash{}2040), medium- (2041\textendash{}2070), and long-term projections (2071\textendash{}2100). Several zones of special concern emerged based on the biomass involved, stand sensitivity, and vulnerability trends across time. Boreal forests in the central regions of Alberta and Saskatchewan appeared most vulnerable to drought-induced mortality in the mid to long term. In the short term, distance to suitable habitat is projected to shift quickly along latitudinal gradients, particularly in Central Canada, while zones of vulnerability to migration failure appeared across the Rockies region in the long term as suitable conditions disappear from mountainous areas. This spatial assessment of vulnerability, which integrates species-specific sensitivity, highlights important regional contrasts between vulnerability to drought (from high exposure, high proportion of sensitive species, or both) and to migration failure. By affecting either species' ability to persist in place or to migrate, different climate change impacts can yield distinct biotic responses, with important implications for regional climate change adaptation strategies. Multi-faceted vulnerability assessments, integrating both exposure and sensitivity indices specific to expected impacts of climate change, have the potential to provide crucial information to managers. We discuss some of these implications, explore the current limitations of our approach, and suggest a path forward.},

  abstract = {1 This study presents statistical methodology that uses spatial explanatory variables to improve simpler estimates of transition probabilities from categorical data, such as vegetation type, that have been recorded as classified cells (pixels) in a grid or lattice at different times. 2 A specific application is to examine successions in semi-natural vegetation in north-east Scotland. Questions related to these data include: Do transition probabilities of a pixel depend on the size of a patch of vegetation (polygon) and pixel location within the polygon? Do stable areas remain stable? Does the proximity of certain vegetation types influence transitions? 3 We selected spatial variables that were likely to be important in this application, where short-range vegetative spread was thought to be an important factor. 4 The multinomial logit model is used to estimate the transition probabilities as a function of explanatory variables, including location, neighbourhood information and other factors recorded at the start of the transition period. This model allowed the testing of different assumptions about the dynamics of underlying processes leading to transitions. 5 When the number of categories, for example vegetation types, observed is large in comparison to the sample size, estimates of transition probabilities can be unreliable. We show that using change of category within the time period as the response in a logistic regression can still provide insight to the underlying dynamics of change in such a case. 6 The methods are illustrated with some Scottish vegetation classification data with pixels of size 5 \texttimes{} 5 m covering a square of area 0{$\cdot$}25 km2. Two contrasting squares were investigated: the first was upland moorland grazed by sheep and the second was a lowland area with more varied vegetation and low intensity grazing by cattle. 7 In both squares there are strong spatial trends, and the neighbourhood of a pixel affected its transition. Prediction misclassification rates estimated from different models were compared using K-fold cross-validation. The multinomial model, including position in the square and number of neighbouring pixels in the same category as the pixel modelled, reduced the misclassification rate compared with the model without spatial explanatory variables. 8 The improved estimates of transition probabilities could be incorporated into Markov models used in simulation studies to predict future vegetation changes under different management strategies.},

Our major innovation is to simultaneously integrate the direct impacts of climate change and land use on biodiversity as well as indirect impacts mediated by climate change effects on land use, all at very fine spatial resolution. In addition, our framework can be used to evaluate incentive-based conservation policies in terms of land use and biodiversity over several decades. The results for our case study in France indicate that the projected effects of climate change dominate the effects of land use on bird abundances. As a conservation policy, implementing a spatially uniform payment for pastures has a positive effect in relatively few locations and only on the least vulnerable bird species.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of succession rates and pathways is crucial for devising restoration strategies for highly disturbed ecosystems such as surface-mined land. As these processes have often only been described in qualitative terms, we used Markov models to quantify transitions between successional stages. However, Markov models are often considered not attractive for some reasons, such as model assumptions (e.g., stationarity in space and time, or the high expenditure of time required to estimate successional transitions in the field). Here we present a solution for converting multivariate ecological time series into transition matrices and demonstrate the applicability of this approach for a data set that resulted from monitoring the succession of sandy dry grassland in a post-mining landscape. We analyzed five transition matrices, four one-step matrices referring to specific periods of transition (1995\textendash{}1998, 1998\textendash{}2001, 2001\textendash{}2004, 2004\textendash{}2007), and one matrix for the whole study period (stationary model, 1995\textendash{}2007). Finally, the stationary model was enhanced to a partly time-variable model. Applying the stationary and the time-variable models, we started a prediction well outside our calibration period, beginning with 100\% bare soil in 1974 as the known start of the succession, and generated the coverage of 12 predefined vegetation types in three-year intervals. Transitions among vegetation types changed significantly in space and over time. While the probability of colonization was almost constant over time, the replacement rate tended to increase, indicating that the speed of succession accelerated with time or fluctuations became stronger. The predictions of both models agreed surprisingly well with the vegetation data observed more than two decades later. This shows that our dry grassland succession in a post-mining landscape can be adequately described by comparably simple types of Markov models, although some model assumptions have not been fulfilled and within-plot transitions have not been observed with point exactness. The major achievement of our proposed way to convert vegetation time series into transition matrices is the estimation of probability of events\textemdash{}a strength not provided by other frequently used statistical methods in vegetation science.},

We review whether landscape connectivity estimates could gain in both precision and generality by incorporating three fundamental outcomes of dispersal theory. Firstly, dispersal is a multi-causal process; its restriction to an `escape reaction' to environmental unsuitability is an oversimplification, as dispersing individuals can leave excellent quality habitat patches or stay in poor-quality habitats according to the relative costs and benefits of dispersal and philopatry. Secondly, species, populations and individuals do not always react similarly to those cues that trigger dispersal, which sometimes results in contrasting dispersal strategies. Finally, dispersal is a major component of fitness and is thus under strong selective pressures, which could generate rapid adaptations of dispersal strategies. Such evolutionary responses will entail spatiotemporal variation in landscape connectivity. We thus strongly recommend the use of genetic tools to: (i) assess gene flow intensity and direction among populations in a given landscape; and (ii) accurately estimate landscape features impacting gene flow, and hence landscape connectivity. Such approaches will provide the basic data for planning corridors or stepping stones aiming at (re)connecting local populations of a given species in a given landscape. This strategy is clearly species- and landscape-specific. But we suggest that the ecological network in a given landscape could be designed by stacking up such linkages designed for several species living in different ecosystems. This procedure relies on the use of umbrella species that are representative of other species living in the same ecosystem.},

Spatial models require substantial data, now more readily available, via remote sensing, and more easily manipulated, in geographical information systems.

We reviewed experiments, observations, and syntheses on the effects of species richness on six ecosystem services: forage, timber, fisheries, climate regulation, agricultural pest control, and water quality. Establishing a direct link from biodiversity to ecosystem-service provision has often been precluded by limited data (i.e., the amount, consistency, or generality of the data) and a mismatch between the variables measured and the final ecosystem service that is relevant to stakeholders. We suggest that encompassing syntheses and a network of interdisciplinary experiments under realistic conditions could fill these gaps and could inform the outcomes of alternative management and policy scenarios within IPBES.},

Experimental evidence for a relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem process rates is compelling, but the issue remains contentious.

We analysed 446 measures of biodiversity effects (252 in grasslands), 319 of which involved primary producer manipulations or measurements. Our analyses show that: biodiversity effects are weaker if biodiversity manipulations are less well controlled; effects of biodiversity change on processes are weaker at the ecosystem compared with the community level and are negative at the population level; productivity-related effects decline with increasing number of trophic links between those elements manipulated and those measured; biodiversity effects on stability measures ({\^O}insurance{\~O} effects) are not stronger than biodiversity effects on performance measures. For those ecosystem services which could be assessed here, there is clear evidence that biodiversity has positive effects on most. Whilst such patterns should be further confirmed, a precautionary approach to biodiversity management would seem prudent in the meantime.},

In particular, network models are being widely used to evaluate the contribution of landscape elements to uphold connectivity and related ecological fluxes. However, monitoring programs and conservation practitioners are overwhelmed by a myriad of network indices without being fully aware of their differences for characterizing the importance of individual habitat patches in fragmented landscapes. We analysed a set of thirteen commonly used graph indices and the forest habitat network of goshawks living in NE Spain in order to (a) evaluate how the patch rank orders derived from these indices differ from each other and (b) identify which indices tend to quantify the same network characteristics and which others are quite unique in addressing topological characteristics that are not considered by the rest. We found that most of the variability in patch rankings can be captured by only three network indices. The largest group of redundant indices corresponded to those that intend to measure the amount of flux received by a given habitat patch. The connector fraction of the integral index of connectivity (IIC) and probability of connectivity (PC) indices and betweenness centrality (BC) stood out as quite unique by focusing on the way habitat patches act as connecting elements between other habitat areas. We discuss which indices can be most beneficial by clearly indicating and differentiating the value of the top patches compared to the others, so that conservation priorities can be established with lower uncertainties. We believe that our results can provide valuable guidelines by facilitating the selection of a few non-redundant and complementary indicators that quantify the important and distinctive roles of habitat patches in maintaining the connectivity of habitat networks.},

  abstract = {Many species have already shifted their distributions in response to recent climate change. Here, we aimed at predicting the future breeding distributions of European birds under climate, land-use, and dispersal scenarios. We predicted current and future distributions of 409 species within an ensemble forecast framework using seven species distribution models (SDMs), five climate scenarios and three emission and land-use scenarios. We then compared results from SDMs using climate-only variables, habitat-only variables or both climate and habitat variables. In order to account for a species' dispersal abilities, we used natal dispersal estimates and developed a probabilistic method that produced a dispersal scenario intermediate between the null and full dispersal scenarios generally considered in such studies. We then compared results from all scenarios in terms of future predicted range changes, range shifts, and variations in species richness. Modeling accuracy was better with climate-only variables than with habitat-only variables, and better with both climate and habitat variables. Habitat models predicted smaller range shifts and smaller variations in range size and species richness than climate models. Using both climate and habitat variables, it was predicted that the range of 71\% of the species would decrease by 2050, with a 335 km median shift. Predicted variations in species richness showed large decreases in the southern regions of Europe, as well as increases, mainly in Scandinavia and northern Russia. The partial dispersal scenario was significantly different from the full dispersal scenario for 25\% of the species, resulting in the local reduction of the future predicted species richness of up to 10\%. We concluded that the breeding range of most European birds will decrease in spite of dispersal abilities close to a full dispersal hypothesis, and that given the contrasted predictions obtained when modeling climate change only and land-use change only, both scenarios must be taken into consideration.},

The sensitivity of tree seedlings of the two dominant species in each community to micro-environmental variations was measured in transitional zones, where all species were present, and these responses compared to the availability of micro-sites in adjacent `pure' communities. Acer saccharum Marsh seedlings exhibited the largest ecological amplitude, and were found growing on the deepest litter layers and where the greatest mass of hardwood litter had accumulated. Abies balsamea (L.) Mill., Picea glauca (Moench) Voss, and Betula alleghaniensis Britton seedlings were found growing where hardwood litter layers were thinnest, more moss was present, and light levels were higher, all conditions most frequent in the boreal community. The results imply that Acer should regenerate well in both community types, while the other three species should regenerate well only in boreal communities. The abruptness of the hardwood/boreal community boundary in this area is explained by the abrupt population boundary of Acer saccharum, the potential regional dominant; this is tentatively attributed to temperature limitation on this species at its northern range limit.},

Below kt, a uniform area distribution across reserves maximizes biodiversity. Beyond kt, biodiversity is maximized by allocating a certain area to one reserve and uniformly allocating the remaining area to the other reserves.

The aim of this paper is to provide a unified framework for the assessment of beta diversity, disentangling the contribution of spatial turnover and nestedness to beta-diversity patterns. Innovation I derive an additive partitioning of beta diversity that provides the two separate components of spatial turnover and nestedness underlying the total amount of beta diversity. I propose two families of measures of beta diversity for pairwise and multiple-site situations. Each family comprises one measure accounting for all aspects of beta diversity, which is additively decomposed into two measures accounting for the pure spatial turnover and nestedness components, respectively. Finally, I provide a case study using European longhorn beetles to exemplify the relevance of disentangling spatial turnover and nestedness patterns. Main conclusion Assigning the different beta-diversity patterns to their respective biological phenomena is essential for analysing the causality of the processes underlying biodiversity. Thus, the differentiation of the spatial turnover and nestedness components of beta diversity is crucial for our understanding of central biogeographic, ecological and conservation issues.},

Therefore, a multispecies approach to designing and monitoring reserve networks is necessary. To gain insight into how the interactions between species in marine communities may affect reserve design, we synthesize marine reserve community models and community models with habitat destruction and fragmentation, and we develop new extensions of existing models. This synthesis highlights the potential for species interactions to alter reserve design criteria; in particular, accounting for species interactions often leads to an increase in reserve size necessary to protect populations. Accounting for species interactions also indicates the need to base reserve design and monitoring on a variety of species, especially long-distance dispersers, inferior colonizers, and specialists. Finally, the new model extensions highlight how, given dispersal, source populations outside reserves as well as increases in fished populations after reserve establishment may negatively affect reserve populations of competitors or prey. Therefore, multispecies harvest dynamics outside reserves and before reserve establishment are critical to determining the appropriate reserve size, spacing, and expectations after establishment. These models highlight the importance of species interactions to reserve design and provide guidelines for how this complexity can begin to be incorporated into conservation planning.},

  abstract = {Understanding the factors regulating the composition and abundance of natural regeneration in forest ecosystems is critical to sustainable management worldwide. Using a long-term silvicultural experiment in Maine, we partitioned the variation in natural regeneration and examined the contribution of overstory and understory vegetation (biotic factors), substrate and soil attributes (abiotic factors), and silvicultural treatment. We hypothesized that silvicultural treatment (single-tree selection with 5, 10, and 20-year cutting cycles and diameter-limit cutting) would be less influential than abiotic and biotic factors in structuring regeneration pattern. Overall, treatment and site (biotic and abiotic) factors accounted for 26\% of the variation in regeneration species composition, highlighting stochasticity of the regeneration process. In support of our hypothesis, regeneration pattern that could be explained was primarily associated with local site factors; overstory and understory vegetation uniquely accounted for 16\% of the variation in species composition. Substrate and soil attributes along with silvicultural treatment accounted for 4\% of variation, and uniquely accounted for 2\% and 4\%, respectively. In support of earlier reports, shifts toward hardwood dominance were apparent at early stages of cohort development and were associated with high harvest intensities. Our findings suggested that overstory and understory vegetation exhibit greater control over regeneration patterns than substrate and soil attributes, or silvicultural treatment, in partially harvested Acadian Forest mixedwood stands, and also indicated the potential for composition control through selective overstory removal.},

  abstract = {Climate change may drastically alter patterns of species distributions and richness, but predicting future species patterns in occurrence is challenging. Significant shifts in distributions have already been observed, and understanding these recent changes can improve our understanding of potential future changes. We assessed how past climate change affected potential breeding distributions for landbird species in the conterminous United States. We quantified the bioclimatic velocity of potential breeding distributions, that is, the pace and direction of change for each species' suitable climate space over the past 60 years. We found that potential breeding distributions for landbirds have shifted substantially with an average velocity of 1.27 km yr{\`A}1, about double the pace of prior distribution shift estimates across terrestrial systems globally (0.61 km yr{\`A}1). The direction of shifts was not uniform. The majority of species' distributions shifted west, northwest, and north. Multidirectional shifts suggest that changes in climate conditions beyond mean temperature were influencing distributional changes. Indeed, precipitation variables that were proxies for extreme conditions were important variables across all models. There were winners and losers in terms of the area of distributions; many species experienced contractions along west and east distribution edges, and expansions along northern distribution edges. Changes were also reflected in the potential species richness, with some regions potentially gaining species (Midwest, East) and other areas potentially losing species (Southwest). However, the degree to which changes in potential breeding distributions are manifested in actual species richness depends on landcover. Areas that have become increasingly suitable for breeding birds due to changing climate are often those attractive to humans for agriculture and development. This suggests that many areas might have supported more breeding bird species had the landscape not been altered. Our study illustrates that climate change is not only a future threat, but something birds are already experiencing.},

  abstract = {Climate conditions, such as temperature or precipitation, averaged over several decades strongly affect species distributions, as evidenced by experimental results and a plethora of models demonstrating statistical relations between species occurrences and long-\- term climate averages. However, long-\-term averages can conceal climate changes that have occurred in recent decades and may not capture actual species occurrence well because the distributions of species, especially at the edges of their range, are typically dynamic and may respond strongly to short-t\-erm climate variability. Our goal here was to test whether bird occurrence models can be predicted by either covariates based on short-t\- erm climate variability or on long-t\- erm climate averages. We parameterized species distribution models (SDMs) based on either short-t\-erm variability or long-t\-erm average climate covariates for 320 bird species in the conterminous USA and tested whether any life-h\- istory trait-b\- ased guilds were particularly sensitive to short-t\-erm conditions. Models including short-t\-erm climate variability performed well based on their cross-\-validated area-u\- nder-t\-he-c\-urve AUC score (0.85), as did models based on long-\-term climate averages (0.84). Similarly, both models performed well compared to independent presence/absence data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (independent AUC of 0.89 and 0.90, respectively). However, models based on short-t\-erm variability covariates more accurately classified true absences for most species (73\% of true absences classified within the lowest quarter of environmental suitability vs. 68\%). In addition, they have the advantage that they can reveal the dynamic relationship between species and their environment because they capture the spatial fluctuations of species potential breeding distributions. With this information, we can identify which species and guilds are sensitive to climate variability, identify sites of high conservation value where climate variability is low, and assess how species' potential distributions may have already shifted due recent climate change. However, long-\-term climate averages require less data and processing time and may be more readily available for some areas of interest. Where data on short-t\-erm climate variability are not available, long-\-term climate information is a sufficient predictor of species distributions in many cases. However, short-\-term climate variability data may provide information not captured with long-\-term climate data for use in SDMs.},

There is, however, currently no regional cumulative impact assessment for the St. Lawrence. Many of the human activities in this area (e.g., shipping, fisheries and aquaculture) impose environmental threats (e.g., habitat destruction) that may jeopardize ecosystem structure and function. Increasingly, these threats are overlapping spatially, which induces synergies causing unpredictable non-linear effects on ecosystems. These effects are still poorly understood and consequently neglected in environmental impact assessments, which remain focused on single species or sectors, and on the approval of specific projects. To efficiently evaluate cumulative impacts in the St. Lawrence, it will be important to: 1) improve our knowledge concerning the impacts of multiple threats to ecosystems; 2) improve the accessibility to, and the applicability of, cumulative impact tools; 3) identify relevant human and environmental indicators of cumulative impacts; 4) create a data sharing, and human impact and environmental monitoring protocol; and 5) develop an adaptive management approach for the St. Lawrence. Systematic planning of the use of natural resources in the St. Lawrence will require an integrated overview of the structure and function of its ecosystems, and of the sources of stresses affecting them. Such an approach will only be feasible once the necessary infrastructures and tools for ecosystem-based management of the area have been developed.},

  abstract = {American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) reproduces sexually, and vegetatively by root suckers. Although many studies have investigated its regeneration response, most did not account for differences that may exist between its two modes of reproduction. This study was performed in an old-growth Acer - Fagus forest in southern Quebec, where beech bark disease had only a minor effect at the time of the study. We compared the density and frequency of occurrence of beech seedlings and root suckers (height {$<$} 30 cm), as well as their morphology, growth, survival, and response to experimental defoliation. Root suckers accounted for \$13\% of beech regeneration at our site. Density and frequency of occurrence were greater for seedlings than suckers, but did not vary with light availability, which was low at our study site (mean: 2.9\%). Seedlings and suckers did not differ in leaf characteristics, but several differences were observed in terms of plant morphology, growth, and survival. Root suckers showed more lateral growth than height growth, and had a lower leaf area index than seedlings. Root suckers had both a greater growth in height and diameter, and a higher survivorship than seedlings (height and diameter growth were, respectively, five and two times greater for suckers than seedlings, and 74\% of suckers survived more than 1 year, compared to 52\% for seedlings). Defoliation treatments, which included levels of defoliation of 50\% and 100\% (1) did not affect current-year extension growth of seedlings and suckers; (2) did not affect seedling diameter growth, but had a negative impact on sucker diameter growth; and (3) affected survivorship for both origins, but had a much greater negative impact on seedling survivorship (none of the completely defoliated seedlings survived over one year, while 55\% of the suckers did). This study showed that several differences exist between small beech seedlings and root suckers in traits that are important determinants of a species' competitive ability. We therefore expect that variation in the relative importance of root suckering among sites might have several community-level implications.},

Soil properties, understory light, seedling emergence and survival, height growth, and density distribution of maple and beech were compared between the old-growth stand and an adjacent managed stand where the abundance of maple regeneration was high. We did not observe any detrimental effect of beech litter on soil properties and maple early establishment. Overall light availability and maple stocking were lower, and maple density declined more markedly with increasing size in the old-growth stand than in the managed stand. The deficient maple regeneration in the old-growth stand might be related to a lack of microsites where light availability is high enough for maple survival, and not to a lack of initial recruitment in this species. In the old-growth stand, beech was located in more shaded microsites than maple but had a higher growth. Size class distributions of maple and beech suggest that beech had a higher survival rate than maple and that beech sprouts had a higher survival rate than beech seedlings. Beech seems to be better adapted than maple to survive in the deep shade of the old-growth stand. However, we expect that maple will regain its dominance in the understory of the Bois{\'e}-des-Muir with increasing stand breakup that is likely to occur in the future.},

Using an exceptional database of vegetation plots (n = 4839) covering an extent of ,55000 km2, we tested whether the inclusion of fine scale edaphic variables would improve model predictions of plant distribution compared to models using only climate predictors. We also tested how well these edaphic variables could predict distribution on their own, to evaluate the assumption that at large extents, distribution is governed largely by climate. We also hypothesized that the relative contribution of edaphic and climatic data would vary among species depending on their growth forms and biogeographical attributes within the study area. We modelled 128 native plant species from diverse taxa using four statistical model types and three sets of abiotic predictors: climate, edaphic, and edaphic-climate. Model predictive accuracy and variable importance were compared among these models and for species' characteristics describing growth form, range boundaries within the study area, and prevalence. For many species both the climate-only and edaphic-only models performed well, however the edaphic-climate models generally performed best. The three sets of predictors differed in the spatial information provided about habitat suitability, with climate models able to distinguish range edges, but edaphic models able to better distinguish within-range variation. Model predictive accuracy was generally lower for species without a range boundary within the study area and for common species, but these effects were buffered by including both edaphic and climatic predictors. The relative importance of edaphic and climatic variables varied with growth forms, with trees being more related to climate whereas lower growth forms were more related to edaphic conditions. Our study identifies the potential for non-climate aspects of the environment to pose a constraint to range expansion under climate change.},

We answer this question through a detailed analysis of contemporary occupancy patterns at cold range edges and by looking for patterns consistent with climate or other environmental (e.g., edaphic) limitations. We first identify each species' realized growing degree-\-day niche to sample zones central, at the tail, or beyond the edge of this niche. We model habitat suitability, based on 11 nonclimate variables, for each species, and compare the availability of, and occupancy on, suitable sites across zones, with the assumption that a limiting climate is likely to result in decreased occupancy or abundance on otherwise suitable sites toward the range limit. We also check for evidence of shifts to warm microclimate conditions at the range limit as a potential indication of climate limitations. Based on our habitat models, we find that the availability of suitable sites declines across these three zones for most species, while occupancy increases on suitable sites at range edge, and abundance does not vary significantly. Some species shifted to sites with warm microclimate conditions; of these, several also declined in abundance suggesting climate limitations. We conclude, however, that for most species studied, suitable site availability appears to determine the northern edges of distribution and, consequently, warming may not necessarily lead to near-t\-erm range expansions.},

Results: We observed significantly increased species richness of bryophytes and decreased richness of vascular plants. Community affinities to N, pH and temperature increased significantly for bryophytes, but not for vascular plants, although the change over time in N affinities for vascular plants was qualitatively in the predicted direction. Bryophytes showed a higher magnitude of temporal community change than vascular plants, both in terms of overall species composition and environmental affinities, indicating a higher responsiveness of bryophytes to environmental change.
Conclusion: Overall, the result of more marked temporal community change for bryophytes suggests that the many studies of changes in vascular plant communities over time might underestimate the sensitivity of the broader plant community (including cryptogams) to environmental change.},

  abstract = {Many studies of individual sites have revealed biotic changes consistent with climate warming (e.g., upward elevational distribution shifts), but our understanding of the tremendous variation among studies in the magnitude of such biotic changes is minimal. In this study we re-surveyed forest vegetation plots 40 years after the initial surveys in three protected areas along a west-to-east gradient of increasingly steep recent warming trends in eastern Canada (Qu{\'e}bec). Consistent with the hypothesis that climate warming has been an important driver of vegetation change, we found an increasing magnitude of changes in species richness and composition from west to east among the three parks. For the two mountainous parks, we found no significant changes in elevational species' distributions in the easternmost park (raw mean = +11.4 m at Forillon Park) where warming has been minimal, and significant upward distribution shifts in the centrally located park (+38.9 m at Mont-M{\'e}gantic) where the recent warming trend has been marked. Community temperature indices (CTI), reflecting the average affinities of locally co-occurring species to temperature conditions across their geographic ranges (``species temperature indices''), did not change over time as predicted. However, close examination of the underpinnings of CTI values suggested a high sensitivity to uncertainty in individual species' temperature indices, and so a potentially limited responsiveness to warming. Overall, by testing a priori predictions concerning variation among parks in the direction and magnitude of vegetation changes, we have provided stronger evidence for a link between climate warming and biotic responses than otherwise possible and provided a potential explanation for large variation among studies in warming-related biotic changes.

  abstract = {To conserve ecological connectivity (the ability to support animal movement, gene flow, range shifts, and other ecological and evolutionary processes that require large areas), conservation professionals need coarse-grained maps to serve as decision-support tools or vision statements and fine-grained maps to prescribe site-specific interventions. To date, research has focused primarily on fine-grained maps (linkage designs) covering small areas. In contrast, we devised 7 steps to coarsely map dozens to hundreds of linkages over a large area, such as a nation, province, or ecoregion. We provide recommendations on how to perform each step on the basis of our experiences with 6 projects: California Missing Linkages (2001), Arizona Wildlife Linkage Assessment (2006), California Essential Habitat Connectivity (2010), Two Countries, One Forest (northeastern United States and southeastern Canada) (2010), Washington State Connected Landscapes (2010), and the Bhutan Biological Corridor Complex (2010). The 2 most difficult steps are mapping natural landscape blocks (areas whose conservation value derives from the species and ecological processes within them) and determining which pairs of blocks can feasibly be connected in a way that promotes conservation. Decision rules for mapping natural landscape blocks and determining which pairs of blocks to connect must reflect not only technical criteria, but also the values and priorities of stakeholders. We recommend blocks be mapped on the basis of a combination of naturalness, protection status, linear barriers, and habitat quality for selected species. We describe manual and automated procedures to identify currently functioning or restorable linkages. Once pairs of blocks have been identified, linkage polygons can be mapped by least-cost modeling, other approaches from graph theory, or individual-based movement models. The approaches we outline make assumptions explicit, have outputs that can be improved as underlying data are improved, and help implementers focus strictly on ecological connectivity.},

  abstract = {Least-cost models for focal species are widely used to design wildlife corridors. To evaluate the least-cost modeling approach used to develop 15 linkage designs in southern California, USA, we assessed robustness of the largest and least constrained linkage. Species experts parameterized models for eight species with weights for four habitat factors (land cover, topographic position, elevation, road density) and resistance values for each class within a factor (e.g., each class of land cover). Each model produced a proposed corridor for that species. We examined the extent to which uncertainty in factor weights and class resistance values affected two key conservation-relevant outputs, namely, the location and modeled resistance to movement of each proposed corridor. To do so, we compared the proposed corridor to 13 alternative corridors created with parameter sets that spanned the plausible ranges of biological uncertainty in these parameters. Models for five species were highly robust (mean overlap 88\%, little or no increase in resistance). Although the proposed corridors for the other three focal species overlapped as little as 0\% (mean 58\%) of the alternative corridors, resistance in the proposed corridors for these three species was rarely higher than resistance in the alternative corridors (mean difference was 0.025 on a scale of 1\textendash{}10; worst difference was 0.39). As long as the model had the correct rank order of resistance values and factor weights, our results suggest that the predicted corridor is robust to uncertainty. The three carnivore focal species, alone or in combination, were not effective umbrellas for the other focal species. The carnivore corridors failed to overlap the predicted corridors of most other focal species and provided relatively high resistance for the other focal species (mean increase of 2.7 resistance units). Least-cost modelers should conduct uncertainty analysis so that decision-makers can appreciate the potential impact of model uncertainty on conservation decisions. Our approach to uncertainty analysis (which can be called a worst-case scenario approach) is appropriate for complex models in which distribution of the input parameters cannot be specified.},

  abstract = {The idea that alternative stable states may exist in communities has been a recurring theme in ecology since the late 1960s, and is now experiencing a resurgence of interest. Since the first papers on the subject appeared, two perspectives have developed to describe how communities shift from one stable state to another. One assumes a constant environment with shifts in variables such as population density, and the other anticipates changes to underlying parameters or environmental ``drivers''. We review the theory behind alternative stable states and examine to what extent these perspectives are the same, and in what ways they differ. We discuss the concepts of resilience and hysteresis, and the role of stochasticity within the two formulations. In spite of differences in the two perspectives, the same type of experimental evidence is required to demonstrate the existence of alternative stable states.},

Location The dry domain of the western United States. Methods Using data from the Forest Inventory and Analysis National Program, we quantified the relationship between probability of occurrence and climate for adults and seedlings of each species with a Bayesian logistic regression. Assuming that distributional differences between life stages highlight shifting regeneration patterns relative to adult trees, we assessed differences between seedlings and adult trees based on predicted probabilities of occurrence and climate envelope boundaries. Results Differences between occurrence probabilities for seedlings and adults were greatest for montane, as opposed to subalpine, species and along range margins, especially in the southern and western portions of the study area. Climate envelope boundaries of seedlings differed from adult trees most frequently in montane species and often suggested range contractions or range shifts, as opposed to range expansion. Main conclusions Our results indicated that climate-induced contractions and shifts in seedling distribution in response to recent change are already under way and are particularly severe in montane tree species. While adult trees may persist for hundreds of years without significant regeneration, tree species ranges will eventually contract where tree regeneration fails.},

In this review, we first examine the different possible effects of climate change that can operate at individual, population, species, community, ecosystem and biome scales, notably showing that species can respond to climate change challenges by shifting their climatic niche along three non-exclusive axes: time (e.g. phenology), space (e.g. range) and self (e.g. physiology). Then, we present the principal specificities and caveats of the most common approaches used to estimate future biodiversity at global and subcontinental scales and we synthesise their results. Finally, we highlight several challenges for future research both in theoretical and applied realms. Overall, our review shows that current estimates are very variable, depending on the method, taxonomic group, biodiversity loss metrics, spatial scales and time periods considered. Yet, the majority of models indicate alarming consequences for biodiversity, with the worstcase scenarios leading to extinction rates that would qualify as the sixth mass extinction in the history of the earth.},

The natural course of succession in this area is hypothetical since forest management over the last 200 years has been depriving the forest vegetation of any chance to develop in its natural way. The second model is time-inhomogeneous and it is applied to an area where secondary succession has really begun after the devastation of spruce stand due to strong SO2-pollution (especially in the 1980s) and removal of spruce from the forest. Taking possible human impact into account, the model can predict vegetation development in the long-term under particular scenarios of forest management and other impacts.

A community may be considered as a black box in the sense that the individual species grow and interact in complicated ways that are difficult to discern. Yet, by observing the response (output) of the system to natural or human\textemdash{}induced disturbances (inputs), information can be gained regarding the character and strengths of species interactions. We decline a perturbation as selective alteration of the density of one or more members of the community, and we distinguish two quite different kinds of perturbations. A PULSE perturbation is a relatively instantaneous alteration of species numbers, after which the system is studied as it 'relaxes' back to its previous equilibrium state. A PRESS perturbation is a sustained alteration of species densities (often a complete elimination of particular species): it is maintained until the unperturbed species reach a new equilibrium. The measure of interest in PRESS perturbation is the net change in densities of the unperturbed species. There is a very important difference between these two approaches: PULSE experiments yield information only on direct interactions (e.g. terms in the interaction matrix), while PRESS experiments yield information on direct interactions mixed together with the indirect effects mediated through other species in the community. We develop mathematical techniques that yield measures of ecological interaction between species from both types of experimental designs. Particular caution must be exercised in interpreting results form PRESS experiments, particularly when some species are lumped into functional categories and others are neglected altogether in the experimental design. We also suggest mathematical methods to deal with temporal and random variation during experiments. Finally, we critically review techniques that rely on natural variation in numbers to estimate species interaction coefficients. The problems with such studies are formidable.},

We used aerial photographs, archives, and dendroecological data (315 sites) to reconstruct a stand initiation map for the area. The cumulative distribution of burnt area in relation to time since fire suggests that the fire frequency has decreased drastically since the end of the Little Ice Age (about 1850) in the entire region. However, a large part of the area was burned between 1910 and 1920 during intensive colonization and when the climate was very conducive to fire. For the period 1920\textendash{}1945, large fires have mainly been concentrated in the more populated southern area, while few fires have been observed in the virgin coniferous forest in the north. Despite slight differences between the south and the north, fire cycles or the average number of years since fire are not significantly different. Since 1945, there have been far more fires in the south, but the mean fire size was smaller than in the north. These results suggest that the transition between the mixed and coniferous forests observed in the southern boreal forest cannot be explained by a difference in fire frequency, at least during the last 300 years. As climatic factors and species potential distribution did not vary significantly from south to north, we suggest that the transition from mixedwood to coniferous forests is mainly controlled by fire size and severity. Smaller and less severe fires would favor species associated with the mixedwood forests as many need survivors to reinvade burnt areas. The abundance of deciduous species in mixedwood forests, together with the presence of more lakes that can act as firebreaks, may contribute to decreases in fire size and severity. The transition between the two vegetation zones could be related to the initial setting following the vegetation invasion of the area during the Holocene. In this context, the limit of vegetation zones in systems controlled by disturbance regimes such as fires may not have reached a balance with current climatic conditions. Historical legacies and strong positive feedback between disturbance regimes and composition may filter and delay the responses to changes in climate.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, there has been an increasing interest in the development of forest management approaches that are based on an understanding of historical natural disturbance dynamics. The rationale for such an approach is that management to favour landscape compositions and stand structures similar to those of natural ecosystems should also maintain biological diversity and essential ecological functions. In fire-dominated landscapes, this approach is possible only if current and future fire frequencies are sufficiently low, in comparison to pre-industrial fire frequency, that we can substitute fire with forest management. I address this question by comparing current and future fire frequency to historical reconstruction of fire frequency from studies in the Canadian boreal forest. Current and simulated future fire frequencies using 2\texttimes{} and 3\texttimes{} CO2 scenarios are lower than the historical fire frequency for most sites, suggesting that forest management could potentially be used to recreate the forest age structure of fire-controlled pre-industrial landscapes. Current even-aged management, however, tends to reduce forest variability: for example, fully regulated, even-aged management will tend to truncate the natural forest stand age distribution and eliminate overmature and old-growth forests from the landscape. The development of silvicultural techniques that maintain a spectrum of forest compositions and structures at different scales in the landscape is one avenue to maintain this variability.},

  abstract = {The combination of certain features of fire disturbance, notably fire frequency, size and severity, may be used to characterize the disturbance regime in any region of the boreal forest. As some consequences of fire resemble the effects of industrial forest harvesting, conventional forest management is often considered as a disturbance that has effects similar to those of natural disturbances. Although the analogy between forest management and fire disturbance in boreal ecosystems has some merit, it is important to recognise that it also has its limitations. Short fire cycles generally described for boreal ecosystems do not appear to be universal; rather, important spatial and temporal variations have been observed in Canada. These variations in the fire cycle have an important influence on forest composition and structure at the landscape and regional levels. Size and severity of fires also show a large range of variability. In regions where the natural matrix of the boreal forest remains relatively intact, maintenance of this natural variability should be targeted by forest managers concerned with biodiversity conservation. Current forest management tends to reduce this variability: for example, fully regulated, even-aged management will tend to truncate the natural forest age distribution and eliminate over-mature and old-growth forests from the landscape. We suggest that the development of strategic-level forest management planning approaches and silvicultural techniques designed to maintain a spectrum of forest compositions and structures at different scales in the landscape is one avenue to maintain this variability. Although we use the boreal forest of Quebec for our examples, it is possible to apply the approach to those portions of the boreal forest where the fire regime favours the development of even-aged stands in burns.},

The objectives were to determine patterns of growth response along soil factor gradients, and to discriminate among modes of community organization (fundamental niche differentiation, shifting competitive hierarchy or continuum concept). 2 Relationships were found between tree species distributions and all measured soil factors (pH and exchangeable calcium, magnesium, potassium, aluminium, ammonium and nitrate). 3 Growth and light data were fitted to a nested series of functions based on the Michaelis-Menten equation. For five of six species, likelihood-ratio tests indicated that functions that incorporated pH or other soil factors predicted growth better than functions based only on light availability. 4 Species differed in the direction and strength of response to soil factors. Fraxinus americana had decreased growth on high-magnesium soils, Acer rubrum had increased growth on high-aluminium soils, Quercus rubra and Fagus grandifolia had increased growth on high-calcium soils and Tsuga canadensis had increased growth on high-nitrate soils. 5 Growth responses were consistent with either fundamental niche differentiation and continuum concept (Acer rubrum), shifting competitive hierarchy and continuum concept (Fagus grandifolia, Quercus rubra and Tsuga canadensis) or were not consistent with any theory (Acer saccharum and Fraxinus americana). 6 Because saplings are associated with the same soil-types as mature trees, further studies in this system should focus on earlier stages of the plant life cycle: dispersal, germination and seedling establishment.},

  abstract = {Tree-ring-based growth patterns of dead and living European silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) trees from a forest stand in Slovenia were compared and used for mortality predictions through time by applying a logistic mortality model. The living trees were classified in 1988 as healthy (healthy crown, productive cambium) or declining (defoliated crown, nonproductive cambium). While the average growth curves of dead and declining trees decreased strongly for about 50 years, the growth rate of healthy trees showed only a weak decrease during the same period. Characteristic recent growth patterns of dead and declining trees were very low growth levels, negative growth trends, and a very low relative growth. Healthy trees, in contrast, showed significantly higher growth levels, positive growth trends, and higher relative growth. Based on growth trends and relative growth as independent variables, the derived logistic mortality model showed high accuracy in predicting dead and healthy trees. According to the model, the declining trees are at a very high risk of dying. Revisiting the living trees in 2003 showed that some of the declining trees had already died in the last few years. Periods of suppressed growth of dead, declining, and healthy trees were interpreted by the mortality model as being lethal only when the trees reached a certain size. The early detection of trees with increased mortality risk may help evaluate and control future mortality in forest stands affected by silver fir dieback.},

These topics that are related to the development of human societies have become increasingly important since the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) or Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. In this article, we are interested in the first issue. We present here many examples of the help that using mathematical programming can provide to decision-makers in the protection of biodiversity. The examples we have chosen concern the selection of nature reserves, the control of adverse effects caused by landscape fragmentation, including the creation or restoration of biological corridors, the ecological exploitation of forests, the control of invasive species, and the maintenance of genetic diversity. Most of the presented models are \textendash{} or can be approximated with \textendash{} linear-, quadratic- or fractional-integer formulations and emphasize spatial aspects of conservation planning. Many of them represent decisions taken in a static context but temporal dimension is also considered. The problems presented are generally difficult combinatorial optimization problems, some are well solved and others less well. Research is still needed to progress in solving them in order to deal with real instances satisfactorily. Moreover, relations between researchers and practitioners have to be strengthened. Furthermore, many recent achievements in the field of robust optimization could probably be successfully used for biodiversity protection, a domain in which many data are uncertain.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new way of using forward selection of explanatory variables in regression or canonical redundancy analysis. The classical forward selection method presents two problems: a highly inflated Type I error and an overestimation of the amount of explained variance. Correcting these problems will greatly improve the performance of this very useful method in ecological modeling. To prevent the first problem, we propose a two-step procedure. First, a global test using all explanatory variables is carried out. If, and only if, the global test is significant, one can proceed with forward selection. To prevent overestimation of the explained variance, the forward selection has to be carried out with two stopping criteria: (1) the usual alpha significance level and (2) the adjusted coefficient of multiple determination () calculated using all explanatory variables. When forward selection identifies a variable that brings one or the other criterion over the fixed threshold, that variable is rejected, and the procedure is stopped. This improved method is validated by simulations involving univariate and multivariate response data. An ecological example is presented using data from the Bryce Canyon National Park, Utah, USA.},

The no-lag hypothesis is the foundation of many ecophysiological models, correlative species distribution modelling and climate reconstruction approaches. Simple lag hypotheses have become prominent in disequilibrium ecology, proposing that communities track climate change following a fixed function or with a time delay. However, more complex dynamics are possible and may lead to memory effects and alternate unstable states. We develop graphical and analytic methods for assessing these scenarios and show that these dynamics can appear in even simple models. The overall implications are that (1) complex community dynamics may be common and (2) detailed knowledge of past climate change and community states will often be necessary yet sometimes insufficient to make predictions of a community's future state.},

We elaborate, extend and partly integrate recent network-based approaches for modeling and supporting the management of fragmented landscapes. In doing so, experimental patch removal techniques and network analytical approaches are merged into one integrated modeling framework for assessing the role of individual patches as connectivity providers. In particular, we focus the analyses on the habitat availability metrics PC and IIC and on the network metric Betweenness Centrality. The combination and extension of these metrics jointly assess both the immediate connectivity impacts of the loss of a particular patch and the resulting increased vulnerability of the network to subsequent disruptions. In using the framework to analyze the connectivity of two real landscapes in Madagascar and Catalonia (NE Spain), we suggest a procedure that can be used to rank individual habitat patches and show that the combined metrics reveal relevant and non-redundant information valuable to assert and quantify distinctive connectivity aspects of any given patch in the landscape. Hence, we argue that the proposed framework could facilitate more ecologically informed decision-making in managing fragmented landscapes. Finally, we discuss and highlight some of the advantages, limitations and key differences between the considered metrics.},

They provided a large-scale (30 985 plots) and representative sample of vegetation between 0 and 2500 m a.s.l. Species response curves along the elevation and exposure gradients were fitted with a logistic regression model. In order to assess the effect of changes in successional stages of the forest stands, we compared plant species shifts in the whole set of stands with those solely in closed stands.
Results: A total of 62 species shifted downward, whereas 113 shifted upward, resulting in a significant upward mean shift of 17.9 m. Upward shifting species were preferentially woody and heliophilous, suggesting a role for forest closure and maturation in the observed changes. Excluding all open forest stages from analyses, the upward trend became weaker ({\`A}3.0 m) and was not significant. Forests of the study area have undergone closure and maturation, more strongly at lower altitudes than at higher ones, producing an apparent shift of species.
Conclusions: In the mountain relief of Southeast France, changes in the successional stages of stands appear as the main cause of the apparent upslope movement of forest species. Since a similar trend of forest maturation exists in large areas throughout Europe, forest dynamics should be better taken into account among the causes of vegetation changes before inferring any climate change effect.},

Despite a rapidly expanding quantitative literature, it remains challenging to conceptualize concurrent changes in multiple trait dimensions (``trait space'') and select quantitative functional diversity methods to test hypotheses prior to analysis. To address this need, we present a widely applicable framework for visualizing ecological phenomena in trait space to guide the selection, application, and interpretation of quantitative functional diversity methods. We describe five hypotheses that represent general patterns of responses to disturbance in functional community ecology and then apply a formal decision process to determine appropriate quantitative methods to test ecological hypotheses. As a part of this process, we devise a new statistical approach to test for functional turnover among communities. Our combination of hypotheses and metrics can be applied broadly to address ecological questions across a range of systems and study designs. We illustrate the framework with a case study of disturbance in freshwater communities. This hypothesis-d\- riven approach will increase the rigor and transparency of applied functional trait studies.},

We quantified these mismatches for 59 tree species in the western US along a soil water balance gradient and found high variability in mismatches among species and among performance measures, often resulting in high costs. We used functional traits to explore how dispersal limitation, migration lags, and competitive exclusion may cause mismatches. Overall, the large variability in mismatches, their costs and the relationship with functional traits highlight the nuanced relationships between species' performance and their distributions.},

  abstract = {Warming has been particularly strong at high latitudes in recent decades and bioclimatic models predict northern shifts in optimal conditions for most species. Climate is a strong predictor of site occupancy for trees at broad spatial scales and interacts with other drivers of forest dynamics. Recent changes in distribution and occupancy patterns should therefore provide the best evidence of a tree species' potential to shift in the direction predicted by bioclimatic models. Studies examining recent distribution changes for plants, however, have mostly done so along altitudinal gradients or have used the latitudinal position of juvenile trees relative to adult ones to infer range dynamics. This study provides rare evidence of latitudinal shifts for 11 northern tree species by assessing recent changes in distribution using globally significant inventories from 1970 to 2002. It also compares observed trends with those inferred from the position of juveniles relative to trees in a single survey. Samplings cover 6456 forest plots in temperate and boreal forests up to treeline in eastern North America. The average overall latitudinal shift was 3.07 6 4.37 km northward although responses were species-specific. Shifts were detected more for juvenile than for adult trees and significant northward ones were detected more at northern range limits than at the median. All species demonstrated increased frequency of plot occupancy for saplings while occupancy generally decreased for adult trees. Five out of the 11 species examined (Acer rubrum, Acer saccharum, Betula papyrifera, Fagus grandifolia, and Populus tremuloides) showed significant distributional shifts consistent with northward migration. Saplings of Abies balsamea, Picea glauca, and Picea mariana, on the other hand, showed southward shifting trends. Natural and human disturbances undoubtedly interact with climate to determine forest dynamics; this study shows whether their combined effect can shift distribution in the direction predicted by bioclimatic models. Only continued monitoring will reveal whether these observations are just transient dynamics or indicative of shifting range in this century. Our study provides a benchmark against which to assess future observations of latitudinal shifts for trees.},

  abstract = {Climate change is expected to result in a reorganization of the continental distribution of tree species. Recent shifts in distribution patterns have been reported, but it is not always clear how climate change influences these patterns locally, especially in relation to other disturbances. We investigated latitudinal shifts of four ecologically important tree species between 1970 and 2014 within a study area that encompasses their northernmost range limit in northeastern North America (Quebec, Canada; 761,000 km2). Changes in latitudinal limits were defined in relation to changes in tree saplings' occurrence patterns within forest plots resampled over two time periods (1970\textendash{}1977 and 2003\textendash{}2014). By examining changes in the frequency of occurrences in different portions of the study area along a latitudinal gradient, we were able to identify spatially explicit patterns of loss or gain (sapling recruitment) resulting in the shifts observed. We then estimated the probability of observing a recruitment event in response to changes in climate, disturbance and their interaction, using a multimodel selection approach. Latitudinal limits of all four species shifted northward, but these shifts resulted from different patterns of plot occurrence changes, depending on the species and the location examined. Greater recruitment at northern locations than at southern ones drove shifts for Acer saccharum Marsh., Fagus grandifolia Ehrh. and Acer rubrum L., but less so for Betula alleghaniensis Britt. Climate variables indicating changes in early or late growing season conditions were most often selected in models. Warming tended to reduce recruitment probability in the south but increase it in the north, leading to divergent responses for a given species across the study area. Disturbance effects were generally less important than climate change effects, as was their interaction. Synthesis. Spatially explicit and divergent responses to climate change and disturbance drive recruitment patterns underlying latitudinal shifts of tree species. The importance of early- or late-season climate variables points towards biological processes being affected at critical stages of the life cycle. Understanding the factors that influence species' migration capacity in a changing climate is crucial to inform adaptive management and conservation practices.},

In each region, three study areas were placed in unmanaged stands that had not burned for more than 200 years. Disturbance impacts and forest succession were evaluated using aerial photographs and dendrochronology. Spruce budworm outbreaks occurred around 1910, 1950, and 1980 in both regions. The 1910 outbreak seemed to have limited impact in both regions, and the 1950 outbreak caused heavy mortality in conifer stands (mostly of balsam fir, Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) in the southern region. The 1980 outbreak caused major mortality in the northern region, but had little impact in the southern region. Successive spruce budworm outbreaks led to a massive invasion by hardwood species in the last century in the southern region but not in the northern region. The reason for such contrasting dynamics between regions is unknown, but we hypothesize that differences in disturbance intensities, influenced by climate, played a major role. Results from this study emphasize that generalizations about the effect of spruce budworm outbreaks on forest dynamics cannot be derived from observations made during a single outbreak or at a single location.

  abstract = {We studied mortality caused by the last spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana Clem.) outbreak (1972\textendash{}1984) and the subsequent regeneration processes in the mixed conifer\textendash{}hardwood forest zone of the T{\'e}miscamingue region, western Qu{\'e}bec. Three kinds of late successional stands, undisturbed by human activities and representative of forest conditions on different sites, were studied using permanent plots, dendrochronology, and field data. The tree species affected directly by the spruce budworm, balsam fir (Abies balsamea L.), white spruce (Picea glauca Moench.), and black spruce (Picea mariana Mill.) suffered high overall mortality rates during the 1972\textendash{}1996 period covered by the permanent plot measurements (97.6, 63.5, and 59.6\%, respectively). The mortality of balsam fir and white spruce were positively correlated with pre-outbreak balsam fir basal area in the plots, as was the mortality of a non-host species, white birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.). Mortality of host and non-host species following the outbreak might have been due in part to modified environmental conditions following canopy disruption, particularly on imperfectly drained sites that were dominated by balsam fir before the outbreak. This is also supported by the fact that radial increments of surviving white spruce trees remained significantly lower after the outbreak in balsam fir-dominated stands compared with other stand types. The outbreak has also favoured the emergence of an abundant sapling layer mostly dominated by balsam fir. Due to important fluctuations in the shape of canopy gaps over the years, the correlations between sapling abundance and actual canopy openings are low for all sapling species. In the present-day mixed species stands, density and species composition of the sapling layer seem to depend more on the presence of suitable micro-sites than canopy openings. These results suggest that the last outbreak gave rise to a gradient of stand regeneration patterns, depending on species composition before the outbreak and host and non-host mortality following it, ranging from overall stand mortality and replacement in balsam fir-dominated stands, dual-cohort structures in mixed boreal stands where mortality was partial, and quasi-gap dynamics in mixed hardwood stands dominated by yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britton).},

  abstract = {In sub-boreal forests of northeastern North America, late-successional stands often contain a fine-scale mixture of several coniferous and hardwood tree species, including an important proportion of relatively shade-intolerant species such as white birch (Betula papyrifera) and yellow birch (B. alleghaniensis). In order to better understand the recruitment of these species, we determined the age at 1 m height of each tree in sample plots located in three stand types representative of different site conditions in a small forest mosaic undisturbed by humans. Three recruitment pulses occurred synchronously in all stand types during the periods 1835-1860, 1910-1930, and 1970-1990, the last two being related to known spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) outbreaks. These pulsed recruitment episodes were identified for birch species, but also for more shade-tolerant species such as balsam fir (Abies balsamifera) and to a lesser degree white cedar (Thuja occidentalis). White cedar was the only species for which there was some recruitment during the 1940-1960 period, but this was restricted to only one stand type located on mesic sites. These results indicate that when examined over relatively long periods of time, resource availability after canopy disturbances is an important factor for the recruitment above 1 m height for most tree species. In sub-boreal forests, periodic and synchronous mortality of balsam fir can favour the emergence of multi-species, multi-cohort stands, especially where soil conditions are adequate for the recruitment of other tree species.},

  abstract = {From a forest management stand point, it is crucial to know which ecological processes are most likely to drive changes in tree species distributions and abundance under warming climate conditions. In this study, we simulated forest dynamics in a 703,580 km2 territory that straddles the boreal and temperate broadleaved forest biomes in the province of Qu{\'e}bec (Canada), under a RCP 8.5 climate change scenario. The objective was to evaluate how future forest composition is sensitive to variation in four potential drivers: fire regimes, harvesting regimes, the capacity of tree species to persist under warmer climate conditions, and species capabilities for longdistance colonization. The results indicate that forest composition in 2100 is most sensitive to variation in the parameters controlling species persistence when conditions become warmer or dryer than the conditions found in their current range. Concretely, this points to avenues of research to improve the accuracy of our predictions regarding the impacts of climate change on forest composition. For instance, we should further investigate the underlying ecological (competition) or physiological (drought stresses) processes that influence tree species persistence at the receding edge of their current distributions.},

Location Boreal forest in central Quebec, eastern Canada. Methods We used a dense network of georeferenced historical ( 1925) forest plots (n = 30 033) to document preindustrial forest composition. We evaluated the magnitude of changes with the present-day using modern plots (1980s to 2000s). We reconstructed a long-term, spatially explicit history of logging, spruce budworm outbreaks (Choristoneura fumiferana [Clem.], SBO), and fire using historical maps and field surveys. Results In the preindustrial period, late successional coniferous taxa (Abies balsamea and Picea spp.) dominated the landscape, whereas early successional deciduous taxa (Betula spp. and Populus spp.) were confined to recently burned areas. In the present-day landscape, large areas dominated by late successional coniferous taxa have been replaced by early successional deciduous taxa. Forest communities dominated by early successional deciduous taxa increased sharply throughout the study area. Logging has been a minor driver of these changes compared to fire and SBOs. Conclusions This study demonstrates the importance of documenting the long-term history of both anthropogenic and natural disturbances in order to assess their relative contributions to the development of the present-day forest ecosystems. Natural disturbances have remained the main drivers of forest composition during the 20th century, whereas logging played a less important role. In the current context of global change, long-term experimental research is required to help forecast impacts of natural disturbances and forest management on boreal forest composition.},

  abstract = {The introduction of logging associated with the industrial era (since \$1900) has modified the natural disturbance regime of the world's boreal forests. The object of this study was to document, using forestry maps prepared in 1950 and 2005 from air photos, the dynamics of high-elevation boreal forest landscapes affected by 20th century logging and natural stand-replacing disturbances. In 1950, the majority of forests in the study area were unlogged ({$>$}88\%) and dominated by old conifers (P81 years of age), predominantly balsam fir and black spruce. Logging activities affected 76.2\% of the study area at least once between 1930 and 2005. Forests located at lower altitudes (710\textendash{}880 m) were more intensively logged than those of higher altitudes (880\textendash{}1050 m). The present-day forest landscape, in contrast to that of 1950, is fragmented and dominated by younger stands. The sectors that have been logged at least once have experienced more forest cover changes relative to undisturbed areas. The 2005 cover composition was relatively similar to that observed on 1950 maps. In the 20th century, natural stand-replacing disturbances were infrequent and had a less extensive effect on the forest landscape than did logging. The fire rotation in the 20th century was more than 3000 years, with the overall stand-replacing natural disturbance rotation approaching 800 years. Our study suggests, at least in the 20th century, that canopy gaps and small-scale windthrows seem to be the principal factors controlling high-altitude natural forest dynamics and that natural stand-replacing disturbances were of little consequence. Twentieth century forestry practices were the most important driving force explaining the present-day age structure of the forest landscape. Ecosystem-based management strategies for high-elevation boreal forests should take this into consideration, and implement silvicultural practices that mimic the natural disturbance regime more closely. We therefore suggest the adoption of strategies that favor partial cuts.},

  abstract = {Forestry practices associated with the industrial era (since \textasciitilde{}1900) have altered the natural disturbance regimes and greatly impacted the world's forests. We quantified twentieth century logging patterns and regional scale consequences in three sub-boreal forest landscapes of Eastern Canada (117,000, 49,400 and 92,300 ha), comparing forestry maps depicting age and forest cover types for early industrial (1930) and present-day (2000) conditions. Results were similar for the three landscapes, indicating large-scale forest change during the twentieth century. In 1930, previous logging activities had been concentrated in the lowlands and along the main hydrographical network, as compared to a more even distribution over the landscapes in 2000, reflecting a decreasing influence of the environmental constraints on forest harvesting. In 1930, old-aged forests ({$>$}100 years) accounted for more than 75\% of the unlogged areas of the three landscapes, as compared to less than 15\% for the present-day conditions. Logging practices have thus inverted the stand age distribution of the landscapes that are currently dominated by young and regenerating stands. The 1930 forest cover types showed a clear relationship with elevation, with conifers located in the lowlands and mixed and deciduous stands restricted to the upper slopes. Between 1930 and 2000, 58\textendash{}64\% of the conifer areas transformed to mixed and deciduous forests, such that no clear altitudinal relationships remained in 2000. We conclude that twentieth century logging practices have strongly altered the preindustrial vegetation patterns in our study area, to the point that ecosystem-based management strategies should be developed to restore conifer dominance, altitudinal gradients, as well as the irregular structure inspired from old forest stands.},

Age and types of forest cover were compared between 1930 and 2002 forest maps. In addition, we compared relative species abundance between living stems and coarse woody debris to study these changes at the stand scale. More than 90\% of the 1930 preindustrial landscape was composed of forest stands older than 100 years. A balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) \textendash{} white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) dominated conifer cover (77\% of the landscape area) formed the landscape matrix across the lowlands and was intermingled with mixed stands of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) and conifers on the highlands. As a result of recurrent logging, stands less than 70 years old accounted for 93\% of the 2002 landscape. From 1930 to 2002, 37\% of the landscape was converted from coniferous to mixed forest, and 19\% evolved towards a deciduous cover. The total number of cover patches doubled to 193, whereas mean patch size decreased twofold to 65 ha. Sugar maple, red maple (Acer rubrum L.), striped maple (Acer pennsylvanicum L.), and white birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) probably experienced a greater increase in abundance, whereas balsam fir, white spruce, and eastern white-cedar (Thuja occidentalis L.) experienced a more pronounced decrease. Because it does not consider preindustrial landscape patterns, the system of ecological land classification currently in use in this area suggests that potential late-successional cover types should be more similar to present-day than to preindustrial conditions.},

Transient phases can however last for decades or centuries, during which both demography and interspecific interactions are expected to play a crucial role. Here, we investigate the response of vegetation to climate warming at high latitudes involving a shift from open vegetation to either boreal (mainly coniferous) or temperate (mainly deciduous) forests. We specifically address how interactions among browsers and vegetation could affect the shift in dominance of vegetation type after climate warming. We characterize the transient dynamics using five measures: 1) asymptotic resilience, i.e. the rate at which equilibrium is restored, 2) initial resilience, the short-term rate of change of the ecosystem after climate change, 3) ecosystem exposure, i.e. the shift of the equilibrium due to climate change, 4) sensitivity, or the time to recover equilibrium, and 5) vulnerability, measured as the cumulative amount of changes in vegetation states during the transient phase. We find that plant\textendash{}herbivore interactions usually extend the length of the transient period and induce more cumulative changes in vegetation types. This result implies that the consideration of multiple interacting species is necessary to provide robust scenarios of how ecosystems will respond to global changes. We furthermore show that plant\textendash{}herbivore interactions disrupt the correlation between the five measures characterizing the transient dynamics, highlighting the need for a full multidimensional characterization of transients.},

  abstract = {In this study we used dendrochronology to reconstruct the history of eastern spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.)) outbreaks over the last 450 years in the Bas-Saint-Laurent region of southeastern Quebec. In total, 260 tree cores were sampled from 204 beams in seven historic buildings and 12 trees in a virgin forest stand. Eight previously documented outbreaks (1975\textendash{}1992, 1947\textendash{}1958, 1914\textendash{}1923, 1868\textendash{}1882, 1832\textendash{}1845, 1805\textendash{}1812, 1752\textendash{}1776, 1710\textendash{}1724) and three presumed previous outbreaks (1678\textendash{}1690, 1642\textendash{}1648, 1577\textendash{}1600) were identified based on periods of growth reduction. Of these 11 confirmed or presumed outbreaks, six were documented for the first time in eastern Quebec. Such data suggest that outbreak frequency has remained quite stable, with a mean interval of about 40 years between the midpoint of successive outbreaks since the mid-16th century. In addition, together with previous studies, our results indicate a strong spatial synchrony of spruce budworm outbreaks across central and eastern Quebec during the last 300 years. Consequently, our study does not support the hypothesis that spruce budworm outbreak frequency and synchrony increased during the 20th century.},

  abstract = {The boreal zone and its ecosystems provide numerous provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services. Because of its resources and its hydroelectric potential, Canada's boreal zone is important to the country's resource-based economy. The region presently occupied by Canada's boreal zone has experienced dramatic changes during the past 3 million years as the climate cooled and repeated glaciations affected both the biota and the landscape. For about the past 7000 years, climate, fire, insects, diseases, and their interactions have been the most important natural drivers of boreal ecosystem dynamics, including rejuvenation, biogeochemical cycling, maintenance of productivity, and landscape variability. Layered upon natural drivers are changes increasingly caused by people and development and those related to human-caused climate change. Effects of these agents vary spatially and temporally, and, as global population increases, the demands and impacts on ecosystems will likely increase. Understanding how humans directly affect terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in Canada's boreal zone and how these effects and actions interact with natural disturbance agents is a prerequisite for informed and adaptive decisions about management of natural resources, while maintaining the economy and environment upon which humans depend. This paper reports on the genesis and present condition of the boreal zone and its ecosystems and sets the context for a detailed scientific investigation in subsequent papers published in this journal on several key aspects: carbon in boreal forests; climate change consequences, adaptation, and mitigation; nutrient and elemental cycling; protected areas; status, impacts, and risks of non-native species; factors affecting sustainable timber harvest levels; terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity; and water and wetland resources.},

  abstract = {Many ecosystems are influenced by disturbances that create specific successional states and habitat structures that species need to persist. Estimating transition probabilities between habitat states and modeling the factors that influence such transitions have many applications for investigating and managing disturbance-prone ecosystems. We identify the correspondence between multistate capture\textendash{}recapture models and Markov models of habitat dynamics. We exploit this correspondence by fitting and comparing competing models of different ecological covariates affecting habitat transition probabilities in Florida scrub and flatwoods, a habitat important to many unique plants and animals. We subdivided a large scrub and flatwoods ecosystem along central Florida's Atlantic coast into 10-ha grid cells, which approximated average territory size of the threatened Florida Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens), a management indicator species. We used 1.0-m resolution aerial imagery for 1994, 1999, and 2004 to classify grid cells into four habitat quality states that were directly related to Florida Scrub-Jay source\textendash{}sink dynamics and management decision making. Results showed that static site features related to fire propagation (vegetation type, edges) and temporally varying disturbances (fires, mechanical cutting) best explained transition probabilities. Results indicated that much of the scrub and flatwoods ecosystem was resistant to moving from a degraded state to a desired state without mechanical cutting, an expensive restoration tool. We used habitat models parameterized with the estimated transition probabilities to investigate the consequences of alternative management scenarios on future habitat dynamics. We recommend this multistate modeling approach as being broadly applicable for studying ecosystem, land cover, or habitat dynamics. The approach provides maximum-likelihood estimates of transition parameters, including precision measures, and can be used to assess evidence among competing ecological models that describe system dynamics.},

  abstract = {Methods: Species plant composition was inventoried in 57 riparian forests located along a gradient of urbanization. To analyse plant communities in terms of their trait composition, community-weighted means were calculated using eight functional traits. Forests were characterized by local (physical features, hydrological regime and historical disturbances) and landscape (surrounding land use) variables. Spatial processes structuring communities were assessed using Moran's eigenvector maps and asymmetric eigenvector maps. The relative importance of these three subsets (local, landscape and spatial variables) on tree, shrub and herb functional composition was quantified by variation partitioning using redundancy analyses.
Results: Functional patterns in riparian forests resulted primarily from environmental filtering (local and landscape variables). Local conditions, especially flood intensity, exerted an overriding selection pressure on functional composition of riparian plant communities. Urbanization seemed to act indirectly on trait patterns through the alteration of hydrological disturbances caused by ongoing and historical land transformation. Nevertheless, dispersal along rivers was also a significant structuring force, while overland dispersal was negligible.
Conclusions: Our study highlights that under severe natural disturbance regimes, the effect of natural filters outweighed the negative effects of urban filters. However, the alteration of natural flooding processes by human activities is also a major mechanism influencing plant trait composition in urban riparian communities as forests subjected to reduced flooding intensity experienced a greater effect of urbanization. The effects of urbanization and of past land uses on plant communities were greater for trees than for shrubs and herbs due to the high turnover rate of the latter. Finally, our results showed the importance of dispersal along rivers for biodiversity even in fragmented urban landscapes.},

Potential drivers of liana distribution at the landscape scale (e.g., surrounding land use, urban heat island) were quantified based on satellite images and land use maps. At the forest scale, we investigated biotic and abiotic variables in 429 sampling plots. We found that at the landscape scale, lianas benefited from urbanization, mainly through warm microclimates created by urban heat islands (UHI) as lianas are not well adapted to cold climates. At the forest scale, lianas were more abundant in disturbed forests and in edge habitats than in less disturbed forest and core habitats. Their fast growth rate enables them to quickly take advantage of high light availability on disturbed sites. Our results suggest that urbanization and ongoing climate changes will lead to an increase in liana abundance in temperate forests.},

  abstract = {Empirical models alongside remotely sensed and station measured meteorological observations are employed to investigate both the local and global direct climate change impacts of alternative forest management strategies within a boreal ecosystem of eastern Norway. Stand-level analysis is firstly executed to attribute differences in daily, seasonal, and annual mean surface temperatures to differences in surface intrinsic biophysical properties across conifer, deciduous, and clear-cut sites. Relative to a conifer site, a slight local cooling of -0.13 \textdegree{}C at a deciduous site and -0.25 \textdegree{}C at a clear-cut site were observed over a 6-year period, which were mostly attributed to a higher albedo throughout the year. When monthly mean albedo trajectories over the entire managed forest landscape were taken into consideration, we found that strategies promoting natural regeneration of coniferous sites with native deciduous species led to substantial global direct climate cooling benefits relative to those maintaining current silviculture regimes \textendash{} despite predicted long-term regional warming feedbacks and a reduced albedo in spring and autumn months. The magnitude and duration of the cooling benefit depended largely on whether management strategies jointly promoted an enhanced material supply over business-as-usual levels. Expressed in terms of an equivalent CO2 emission pulse at the start of the simulation, the net climate response at the end of the 21st century spanned -8 to -159 Tg-CO2-eq., depending on whether near-term harvest levels increased or followed current trends, respectively. This magnitude equates to approximately -20 to -300\% of Norway's annual domestic (production) emission impact. Our analysis supports the assertion that a carbon-only focus in the design and implementation of forest management policy in boreal and other climatically similar regions can be counterproductive \textendash{} and at best \textendash{} suboptimal if boreal forests are to be used as a tool to mitigate global warming.},

We measured canopy loss in 1998 of 2,919 trees in 164 forest plots distributed across the Ottawa, Ontario region. In 2000, we measured branch sprouting in the same trees. We found a positive cross-species relationship between the proportion of stems damaged by the ice storm and the proportion of stems showing branch sprouting in response to damage (r = 0.498, P = 0.01). Prunus serotina and Acer rubrum showed exceptionally high sprouting-to-damage ratios, whereas Fagus grandifolia and Populus tremuloides showed exceptionally low ratios. Mean percent crown loss and mean number of branch sprouts on damaged stems were also correlated across species (r = 0.404, P = 0.04). Prunus serotina and Quercus macrocarpa showed exceptionally high mean number of branch sprouts and Carpinus caroliniana showed exceptionally low mean number of branch sprouts compared to other species. No conifer species showed any branch sprouting. We predict that due to these different sprouting-to-damage ratios, species such as Prunus serotina, Acer rubrum, and possibly Quercus macrocarpa, may become better represented in the forest canopy while Fagus grandifolia, Populus tremuloides, and conifer species may become less well represented in the canopy in the short-term.

Current reliance on bioclimatic envelope approaches ignores important biological processes such as interactions and dispersal. Although much debated, it is unclear how such processes might influence range shifting. Using individual-based modelling we show that interspecific interactions and dispersal ability interact with the rate of climate change to determine range-shifting dynamics in a simulated community with two growth forms\textemdash{}mutualists and competitors. Interactions determine spatial arrangements of species prior to the onset of rapid climate change. These lead to space-occupancy effects that limit the rate of expansion of the fast-growing competitors but which can be overcome by increased longdistance dispersal. As the rate of climate change increases, lower levels of long-distance dispersal can drive the mutualists to extinction, demonstrating the potential for subtle process balances, non-linear dynamics and abrupt changes from species coexistence to species loss during climate change.},

  abstract = {Comparative, quantitative biogeographic studies are revealing empirical patterns of interspecific variation in the sizes, shapes, boundaries, and internal structures of geographic ranges; these patterns promise to contribute to understanding the historical and ecological processes that influence the distributions of species. This review focuses on characteristics of ranges that appear to reflect the influences of environmental limiting factors and dispersal. Among organisms as a whole, range size varies by more than 12 orders of magnitude. Within genera, families, orders, and classes of plants and animals, range size often varies by several orders of magnitude, and this variation is associated with variation in body size, population density, dispersal mode, latitude, elevation, and depth (in marine systems). The shapes of ranges and the dynamic changes in range boundaries reflect the interacting influences of limiting environmental conditions (niche variables) and dispersal/extinction dynamics. These processes also presumably account for most of the internal structure of ranges: the spatial patterns and orders-of-magnitude of variation in the abundance of species among sites within their ranges. The results of this kind of ``ecological biogeography'' need to be integrated with the results of phylogenetic and paleoenvironmental approaches to ``historical biogeography'' so we can better understand the processes that have determined the geographic distributions of organisms.},

  abstract = {Controversies about successional dynamics of woodland communities have a long history, dating back to the classical debates between Clements and Gleason and continuing into the present. These debates have largely concerned the predictability or convergence of forest developmental trends as well as the relative importance of different mechanisms and forces driving forest succession. However, opportunities for rigorous testing of competing hypotheses are limited, mainly because plot-based studies of forest vegetation spanning more than a decade are scarce and even fewer concern late-successional stands. We exploit a unique long-term dataset from mesic temperate forests of eastern Poland, spanning c. 80 years (1936\textendash{}2012) in strictly protected, late-successional woodlands assigned to seven different `structural types'. We use non-metric multidimensional scaling to assess the stability of species composition over the study period. We examine the predictability of composition and change trajectories over time using Mantel statistics, and we examine the changes in distributions of dissimilarity indices to assess convergence or divergence at the examined time and spatial scales. Tree communities in Bia{\l}owie{\.z}a Forest have changed substantially over the last eight decades. Several species (aspen, birch, pine, oak, ash, maple and spruce) exhibited large decreases in density, while a few other species (especially hornbeam and lime) have increased in importance across a wide range of initial compositional types. Forest types recognized in earlier periods have become much less distinguishable. Metrics do not yet show clear successional convergence, mainly due to (a) decline in the previously broadly distributed spruce and (b) persistence of large individuals of intermediate, long-lived species (even though these species lack significant regeneration). Synthesis. Late-successional woodland communities of Bia{\l}owie{\.z}a Forest are clearly dynamic and do not show quasi-equilibrial properties often assumed of old-growth forests. Forest types previously recognized as distinct have become progressively less differentiated. Plausible explanations invoke alteration in competitive relationships due to complex changes in environment, including warming climate, N deposition, natural and human disturbance, and ungulate herbivory over 80 years. Hornbeam and lime have been favoured over spruce, pine, oak and birch, although potential successional convergence is far from complete at this time. In the absence of major disturbance, we expect future decades to show continued successional homogenization.},

These individualistic shifts are inconsistent with common forecasting techniques based on environmental rather than biological niches. What biological details could enhance forecasts? Organismal characteristics such as thermal and hydric limits, seasonal timing and duration of the life cycle, ecological breadth and dispersal capacity, and fitness and evolutionary potential are expected to influence climate change impacts. We review statistical and mechanistic approaches for incorporating traits in predictive models as well as the potential to use phylogeny as a proxy for traits. Traits generally account for a significant but modest fraction of the variation in phenological and range shifts. Further assembly of phenotypic and phylogenetic data coupled with the development of mechanistic approaches is essential to improved forecasts of the ecological consequences of climate change.},

  abstract = {The assessment of climate change impacts on biodiversity has so far been biased toward the taxonomic identification of the species likely either to benefit from climate modifications or to experience overall declines. There have still been few studies intended to correlate the characteristics of species to their sensitivity to climate change, even though it is now recognized that functional trait-based approaches are promising tools for addressing challenges related to global changes. In this study, two functional indices (originality and uniqueness) were first measured for 35 fish species occurring in French streams. They were then combined to projections of range shifts in response to climate change derived from species distribution models. We set out to investigate: (1) the relationship between the degrees of originality and uniqueness of fish species, and their projected response to future climate change; and (2) the consequences of individual responses of species for the functional diversity of fish assemblages. After accounting for phylogenetic relatedness among species, we have demonstrated that the two indices used measure two complementary facets of the position of fish species in a functional space. We have also rejected the hypothesis that the most original and/or less redundant species would necessarily experience the greatest declines in habitat suitability as a result of climate change. However, individual species range shifts could lead simultaneously both to a severe decline in the functional diversity of fish assemblages, and to an increase in the functional similarity among assemblages, supporting the hypothesis that disturbance favors communities with combination of common traits and biotic homogenization as well. Our findings therefore emphasize the importance of going beyond the simple taxonomic description of diversity to provide a better assessment of the likely future effects of environmental changes on biodiversity, thus helping to design more effective conservation and management measures.},

  abstract = {Interactions between multiple disturbances are of special concern in ecology due to their potential for non-linear behavior and long-lasting legacies on landscape structure and function. If multiple disturbances overcome the ecological resilience of a system, alternate stable states are possible. Increases in the frequency and severity of disturbance events as a result of climate change heighten this concern. This study directly addresses the question of ecosystem resilience in the face of multiple disturbances. We investigated a gradient of disturbance interaction severities between two events in a subalpine forest, a 1997 windstorm (variable severity) and a 2002 wildfire (high-severity). A third disturbance, salvage logging of blowdown (1999\textendash{}2001) prior to the fire, served as a de facto experimental treatment. Ninetynine study plots were established across the disturbance gradient, including fire-only areas for a baseline fire response. Modeling indicated that the combination of two severe disturbances created novel conditions which exceeded the resilience mechanisms of the system. Modeled mean fire residence time and temperature (First Order Fire Effects Model, FOFEM), as well as mean distance to potential seed sources, increased as a result of the interaction. Regeneration 8 years post-fire was essentially absent in medium- to high-severity blowdown {\th} fire plots, whereas low-severity blowdown {\th} fire and fire-only areas showed strong regeneration. Blowdown {\th} salvage {\th} fire had significantly higher regeneration than areas of comparable blowdown, suggesting that fuel loading drove the interaction. CART analysis supported this hypothesis. Multiple disturbances have the potential to create surprising situations and reduce the resilience of an ecosystem. Differential recovery as a result of a ``novel disturbance'' created by compounding events will likely have long lasting legacies across the landscape.},

  abstract = {Disturbances (e.g. fires, floods, windstorms, landslides, and tsunamis) are ubiquitous throughout the world. Many social and ecological systems have resilience mechanisms to accommodate and recover from such events. Yet, in an era of directional climate change, adaptation (rather than recovery to the same state) may be the most logical path. In such cases, disturbances, while often unwelcome, may function as opportunities for change. We synthesize the literature on disturbances and adaptation to climate change for both ecological and social systems, attempting to find commonalities and situations where disturbances present adaptation opportunities. We also identify three major characteristics of systems that may drive differential potential for success going forward: their overall richness of actors, their functional overlap in diversity, and their temporal rate of change. Social systems are better positioned to successfully take advantage of disturbance-generated opportunities to adapt when they support collaboration of diverse interests and engage in pre-disturbance response planning to seize opportunities when they arise. Ecological systems are well-positioned for adaptation when they are diverse, populated with species that are tolerant of post-disturbance environments, and when life history traits are well-matched with the temporal and spatial distribution of those disturbances. Social systems with a lack of planning and inclusive participation and where powerful actors are resistant to change are less able to take advantage of disturbances as adaptational opportunities; ecological systems that are less diverse (spatially and in regards to species composition), especially those dominated by late successional species, are similarly constrained. Overall, we find that disturbances can create opportunities for adaptation when the ecology and social systems are aligned but there are also many situations where this is not true, depending on initial conditions, temporal pace of disturbance, and system characteristics. Policy implications. Disturbances, while damaging and often catastrophic in the short term, present climate adaptation opportunities because they can spur reorganization towards climatically suitable systems. Policy makers and advocates should carefully consider current social and ecological conditions, specifically how they will reorganize post-disturbance, and explore the options available to prepare and take advantage of (inevitable) future disturbances.},

Recent work has shifted the focus from spatially local (a-diversity) to macroecological scales (b- and c-diversity), emphasizing links between macroecological biodiversity and ecosystem functions (MB\textendash{}EF relationships). However, before the outcomes of MB\textendash{}EF analyses can be useful to real-world decisions, empirical modeling needs to be developed for natural ecosystems, incorporating a broader range of data inputs, environmental change scenarios, underlying mechanisms, and predictions. We outline the key conceptual and technical challenges currently faced in developing such models and in testing and calibrating the relationships assumed in these models using data from real ecosystems. These challenges are explored in relation to two potential MB\textendash{}EF mechanisms: ``macroecological complementarity'' and ``spatiotemporal compensation.'' Several regions have been sufficiently well studied over space and time to robustly test these mechanisms by combining cutting-edge spatiotemporal methods with remotely sensed data, including plant community data sets in Australia, Europe, and North America. Assessing empirical MB\textendash{}EF relationships at broad spatiotemporal scales will be crucial in ensuring these macroecological processes can be adequately considered in the management of biodiversity and ecosystem functions under global change.},

We define the reproduction niche and discuss how temperature influences several stages of the reproductive process. Furthermore, we review examples that illustrate how the reproduction niche influences species distributions and discuss how aspects of the reproduction niche could be considered in SDMs. We show that the reproduction niche fundamentally influences species distributions and that in principle it is easy to include aspects of the reproduction niche in SDMs, although sufficient data are only available for a restricted number of species. Bayesian methods and inverse parameterization may be the most efficient way to use existing data.},

Using field reconnaissance, remote sensing, and literature review we described and modeled the latitude-elevation relationship for Appalachian spruce-fir. The elevation of the spruce fir/deciduous forest ecotone decreases from 1,680 m at 35? N to 150 m at 49? N, while the elevation of treeline (spruce-fir/tundra ecotone) decreases from 1,480 m at 44?

These values compare to literature reports of -54 to - 230 m/l? Latitude and are most similar to values reported from eastern Asia. The latitude-elevation relationship for mean July temperature ( - 94 to - 121 m/l? Latitude) was more similar to the slopes of these ecotones than is the slope for mean annual temperature (- 170 to -220m/l? Latitude).

Addressing questions about community dynamics requires ways of representing and comparing the variety of dynamics observed across space. Until now, most analytical frameworks have been based on the comparison of synchronous observations across sites and between repeated surveys. An alternative perspective considers community dynamics as trajectories in a chosen space of community resemblance and utilizes trajectories as objects to be analyzed and compared using their geometry. While methods that take this second perspective exist, for example to test for particular trajectory shapes, there is a need for formal analytical frameworks that fully develop the potential of this approach. By adapting concepts and procedures used for the analysis of spatial trajectories, we present a framework for describing and comparing community trajectories. A key element of our contribution is the means to assess the geometric resemblance between trajectories, which allows users to describe, quantify, and analyze variation in community dynamics. We illustrate the behavior of our framework using simulated data and two spatiotemporal community data sets differing in the community properties of interest (species composition vs. size distribution of individuals). We conclude by evaluating the advantages and limitations of our community trajectory analysis framework, highlighting its broad domain of application and anticipating potential extensions.},

  abstract = {Three flawed practices associated with model averaging coefficients for predictor variables in regression models commonly occur when making multimodel inferences in analyses of ecological data. Model?averaged regression coefficients based on Akaike information criterion (AIC) weights have been recommended for addressing model uncertainty but they are not valid, interpretable estimates of partial effects for individual predictors when there is multicollinearity among the predictor variables. Multicollinearity implies that the scaling of units in the denominators of the regression coefficients may change across models such that neither the parameters nor their estimates have common scales, therefore averaging them makes no sense. The associated sums of AIC model weights recommended to assess relative importance of individual predictors are really a measure of relative importance of models, with little information about contributions by individual predictors compared to other measures of relative importance based on effects size or variance reduction. Sometimes the model?averaged regression coefficients for predictor variables are incorrectly used to make model?averaged predictions of the response variable when the models are not linear in the parameters. I demonstrate the issues with the first two practices using the college grade point average example extensively analyzed by Burnham and Anderson. I show how partial standard deviations of the predictor variables can be used to detect changing scales of their estimates with multicollinearity. Standardizing estimates based on partial standard deviations for their variables can be used to make the scaling of the estimates commensurate across models, a necessary but not sufficient condition for model averaging of the estimates to be sensible. A unimodal distribution of estimates and valid interpretation of individual parameters are additional requisite conditions. The standardized estimates or equivalently the t statistics on unstandardized estimates also can be used to provide more informative measures of relative importance than sums of AIC weights. Finally, I illustrate how seriously compromised statistical interpretations and predictions can be for all three of these flawed practices by critiquing their use in a recent species distribution modeling technique developed for predicting Greater Sage?Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) distribution in Colorado, USA. These model averaging issues are common in other ecological literature and ought to be discontinued if we are to make effective scientific contributions to ecological knowledge and conservation of natural resources.},

  abstract = {American beech (Fagus grandifolia) in the eastern United States and Canada has experienced more than a century of mortality under a steady expansion of disease agents collectively causing beech bark disease (BBD). In North America, BBD consists of insect (e.g., Cryptococcus fagisuga [beech scale] and Xylococculus betulae) and phytopathogenic fungal (Neonectria faginata and N. ditissima) components that can variously interact with host and environment to cause extensive aboveground mortality of beech (i.e., killing front stage). This heavy mortality causes cascading impacts on forest ecosystems, resulting in altered biotic and abiotic conditions in which BBD-inducted mortality persists at reduced levels (i.e., aftermath stage). New evidence suggests that in aftermath conditions, disease agents interact with each other and their environment in ways neither observed nor anticipated from earlier studies of initial disease onset. Previously unrecognized factors such as atmospheric pollution and nutrient imbalances may exacerbate tree susceptibility to this disease. A clearer understanding of BBD-related organisms and their behavior, disease progression and impacts, and interactions between biotic and abiotic factors is needed to support the development of management options aimed at ameliorating economic and ecological consequences of disease-induced forest change. We comprehensively review over a century of literature in order to clarify these aspects in forests newly- and chronically-affected by BBD. Furthermore, we discuss new concerns of a reemergence of heavy mortality in some aftermath forests and present critical knowledge gaps and key considerations to help inform future BBD research and management programs.},

  abstract = {Some disturbances can drive ecological systems to abrupt shifts between alternative stages (tipping points) when critical transitions occur. Drought-induced tree death can be considered as a nonlinear shift in tree vigour and growth. However, at what point do trees become predisposed to drought-related dieback and which factors determine this (tipping) point? We investigated these questions by characterizing the responses of three tree species, silver fir (Abies alba), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis), to a severe drought event. We compared basal area increment (BAI) trends and responses to climate and drought in declining (very defoliated and dying) vs. non-declining (slightly or not defoliated) trees by using generalized additive mixed models. Defoliation, BAI and sapwood production were related to functional proxies of tree vigour measured at the onset and end of the drought (non-structural carbohydrate concentrations, needle N content and C isotopic discrimination, presence of wood-inhabiting fungi). We evaluated whether early warning signals (increases in synchronicity among trees or in autocorrelation and standard deviation) could be extracted from the BAI series prior to tree death. Declining silver fir and Scots pine trees showed less growth than non-declining trees one to three decades, respectively, before the drought event, whereas Aleppo pines showed growth decline irrespective of tree defoliation. At the end of the drought period, all species showed increased defoliation and a related reduction in the concentration of sapwood soluble sugars. Defoliation was constrained by the BAI of the previous 5 years and sapwood production. No specific wood-inhabiting fungi were found in post-drought declining trees apart from blue-stain fungi, which extensively affected damaged Scots pines. Declining silver firs showed increases in BAI autocorrelation and variability prior to tree death. Synthesis. Early warning signals of drought-triggered mortality seem to be species specific and reflect how different tree species cope with drought stress. Highly correlated declining growth patterns during drought can serve as a signal in silver fir, whereas changes in the content of sapwood soluble sugars are suitable vigour proxies for Scots and Aleppo pines. Longer growth and defoliation series, additional vigour parameters and multi-species comparisons are required to understand and predict drought-induced tree death.},

Historically, much effort has focused on niche-mediated processes to explain these structures, while an emerging consensus posits that both niche and neutral mechanisms simultaneously shape many features of ecological communities. However, the study of interaction networks still lacks a comprehensive neutral theory. Here we present a neutral model of predator-prey interactions and analyze the structural characteristics of the simulated networks. We find that connectance values (complexity) and complexity-diversity relationships of neutral networks are close to those observed in empirical bipartite networks. High nestedness and low modularity values observed in neutral networks fall in the range of those from empirical antagonist bipartite networks. Our results suggest that, as an alternative to niche-mediated processes that induce incompatibility between species (``niche forbidden links''), neutral processes create ``neutral forbidden links'' due to uneven species abundance distributions and the low probability of interaction between rare species. Neutral trophic networks must be seen as the missing endpoint of a continuum from niche to purely stochastic approaches of community organization.},

We use data from the Forest Inventory and Analysis program to quantify the relationships between two key climate variables\textemdash{}mean annual temperature and growing season water deficit\textemdash{}and rates of seedling recruitment and survival for the 50 most common tree species in the eastern United States. Our statistical models include the positive effects of conspecific adult abundance on recruitment and the potentially negative competitive effects of total canopy abundance on seedling survival. The tradeoff between these two effects creates a range from positive to negative conspecific density dependence, depending on the absolute and relative abundance of conspecific vs. heterospecific adults in a plot. Variation along the climate gradients mirrors patterns found previously in adult distributions. The clearest signal is in variation in the presence/absence of seedlings, while seedling density when present is only weakly related to local climate. The relatively narrow niche breadths for the presence of both seedlings and adults suggest that the frequency of occurrence of species within the landscape, rather than their relative abundance when present, will show the greatest response to climate change. Our analyses predict seedling survival as a function of mean annual temperature independent of the effects of competition and water deficit and thus provide an indication of the fundamental niche for seedling distribution along the temperature gradient. For more than half of the 50 species, their realized seedling niches are displaced to warmer climates. This reflects the prevalence of species in which survival declines with increasing temperature across a significant portion of at least their southern range. Our results show that when the effects of warmer climates are taken into account, seedling survival generally increases with increasing water deficit in the generally humid climates of the eastern United States. This result is consistent with recent global surveys of the relationship between net primary productivity and forest turnover rates, but contrasts with recent studies highlighting the potential impact of drought stress on tree mortality in more arid climates.},

  abstract = {We use permanent-plot data from the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program for an analysis of the effects of competition on tree growth along environmental gradients for the 14 most abundant tree species in forests of northern New England, USA. Our analysis estimates actual growth for each individual tree of a given species as a function of average potential diameter growth modified by three sets of scalars that quantify the effects on growth of (1) initial target tree size (dbh), (2) local environmental conditions, and (3) crowding by neighboring trees. Potential growth of seven of the 14 species varied along at least one of the two environmental axes identified by an ordination of relative abundance of species in plots. The relative abundances of a number of species were significantly displaced from sites where they showed maximum potential growth. In all of these cases, abundance was displaced to the more resource-poor end of the environmental gradient (either low fertility or low moisture). The pattern was most pronounced among early successional species, whereas late-successional species reached their greatest abundance on sites where they also showed the highest growth in the absence of competition. The analysis also provides empirical estimates of the strength of intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects of neighbors. For all but one of the species, our results led us to reject the hypothesis that all species of competitors have equivalent effects on a target species. Most of the individual pairwise interactions were strongly asymmetric. There was a clear competitive hierarchy among the four most shade-tolerant species, and a separate competitive hierarchy among the shade-intolerant species. Our results suggest that timber yield following selective logging will vary dramatically depending on the configuration of the residual canopy, because of interspecific variation in the magnitude of both the competitive effects of different species of neighbors and the competitive responses of different species of target trees to neighbors. The matrix of competition coefficients suggests that there may be clear benefits in managing for specific mixtures of species within local neighborhoods within stands.},

  abstract = {An approach to simultaneously estimate parameters of an annual tree growth model was developed, in which the sum of log-likelihood functions for tree survival and diameter growth was maximized. Four methods for acquiring interim values of stand density were evaluated: (1) Updating Attributes, in which individual tree values were summarized at the end of each year within the growth period to predict interim stand-level attributes, (2) Predicting Attributes, in which stand attributes were predicted annually using a stand-level model, (3) Linear Interpolation, in which stand attributes were predicted by linear interpolation, and finally (4) Initial Values, in which stand attributes at the beginning of the growth period were used as predictors throughout the growing period, and the rate of change for tree survival and diameter was assumed to be constant for this period. Data from the Southwide Seed Source Study of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) showed that, overall, the Updating Attributes and Predicting Attributes produced better evaluation statistics in predicting tree survival and diameter growth than did the other two methods. A simulation study confirmed that these two methods produced the least biased estimates of parameters. Compared with the Updating Attributes method, the Predicting Attributes method produced similar evaluation statistics in predicting tree survival and diameter growth and similar bias in estimating model parameters. The Predicting Attributes method therefore offers a reasonable alternative to the Updating Attributes method, because of the ease of programming in available software languages. FOR.

  abstract = {The idea that productivity regulates species diversity is deeply ingrained in the field of ecology. Yet, over the past few decades, an increasing number of experiments have shown that species diversity controls, rather than simply responds to, biomass production. These contrasting perspectives have led to a seeming paradox: Is diversity the cause or the consequence of biological production? Here we present empirical evidence for the multivariate productivity\textendash{}diversity (MPD) hypothesis, which argues that differing perspectives on productivity\textendash{}diversity relationships can be resolved by recognizing that historical research has focused on how resource supply regulates both the productivity and richness of local competitors, whereas more recent studies have focused on how the richness of a colonist pool regulates the efficiency by which resources are captured and converted into new tissue. The MPD hypothesis predicts that three pathways operate concurrently to generate productivity\textendash{}diversity relationships in nature: (1) resource supply directly limits the standing biomass and/or rate of new production by primary producers, (2) producer biomass is directly influenced by the richness of species that locally compete for resources, and (3) resource supply rate indirectly affects producer biomass by influencing the fraction of species from a colonist pool that locally coexist. To examine whether this set of pathways explains covariation between productivity and diversity in natural streams, we used nutrient-diffusing agar ``patches'' to manipulate resource supply rates in 20 streams throughout the Sierra Nevada mountain range, California, USA. We then measured the fraction of periphyton species from the stream colonist pool co-occurring on each nutrient patch, as well as the standing biomass and rates of primary production. Natural patterns of covariation agreed with predictions of the MPD hypothesis. Algal biomass was an increasing function of nutrient supply, and an increasing function of local richness. The fraction of species from the colonist pool found cooccurring on a patch was a concave-down function of nutrient supply, causing nutrients to indirectly affect biomass via control over local richness. These results suggest that the MPD hypothesis is a viable explanation of patterns of diversity and productivity in natural stream ecosystems, and that it has potential to merge the historical view that productivity drives diversity with a parallel view that diversity drives productivity.},

  abstract = {Background A better understanding of the relationship between stand structure and productivity is required for the development of: a) scalable models that can accurately predict growth and yield dynamics for the world's forests; and b) stand management regimes that maximize wood and/or timber yield, while maintaining structural and species diversity. Methods We develop a cohort-based canopy competition model (``CAIN''), parameterized with inventory data from Ontario, Canada, to examine the relationship between stand structure and productivity. Tree growth, mortality and recruitment are quantified as functions of diameter and asymmetric competition, using a competition index (CAIh) defined as the total projected area of tree crowns at a given tree's mid-crown height. Stand growth, mortality, and yield are simulated for inventoried stands, and also for hypothetical stands differing in total volume and tree size distribution. Results For a given diameter, tree growth decreases as CAIh increases, whereas the probability of mortality increases. For a given CAIh, diameter growth exhibits a humped pattern with respect to diameter, whereas mortality exhibits a U-shaped pattern reflecting senescence of large trees. For a fixed size distribution, stand growth increases asymptotically with total density, whereas mortality increases monotonically. Thus, net productivity peaks at an intermediate volume of 100\textendash{}150 m3/ha, and approaches zero at 250 m3/ha. However, for a fixed stand volume, mortality due to senescence decreases if the proportion of large trees decreases as overall density increases. This size-related reduction in mortality offsets the density-related increase in mortality, resulting in a 40\% increase in yield. Conclusions Size-related variation in growth and mortality exerts a profound influence on the relationship between stand structure and productivity. Dense stands dominated by small trees yield more wood than stands dominated by fewer large trees, because the relative growth rate of small trees is higher, and because they are less likely to die.},

  abstract = {We quantified supply and establishment limitation as components of seedling recruitment for five species common to the temperate forests of central Ontario. Establishment limitation was the primary cause of recruitment failure for the three most common species: Acer saccharum Marsh., Betula alleghaniensis Britt., and Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carri{\`e}re. The main barrier to establishment (including germination and seedling emergence) was a lack of suitable substrates, rather than a lack of light. Supply limitation, on the other hand, was the primary cause of recruitment failure for two less common species, Abies balsamea (L.) Mill. and Fagus grandifolia Ehrh. The cause of supply limitation was a lack of parent trees, in the case of A. balsamea, and low fecundity, in the case of F. grandifolia. Our results suggest that niche differences (i.e., germination requirements) are more important than dispersal in structuring temperate forest communities. Our results also suggest that availability of suitable substrates is the primary factor limiting seedling recruitment following logging.},

As a consequence, the composition of these communities is being reshuffled, in most cases leading to a surge in taxonomic similarity at the regional scale termed homogenization. The drivers of homogenization remain unclear, which may be a reflection of interactions between various environmental changes. In this study, we investigate two potential drivers of the recent changes in the composition of freshwater fish communities: recreational fishing and climate change. Our results, derived from 524 lakes of Ontario, Canada sampled in two periods (1965-1982 and 2008-2012), demonstrate that the main contributors to homogenization are the dispersal of gamefish species, most of which are large predators. Alternative explanations relating to lake habitat (e.g., area, phosphorus) or variations in climate have limited explanatory power. Our analysis suggests that humanassisted migration is the primary driver of the observed compositional shifts, homogenizing freshwater fish community among Ontario lakes and generating food webs dominated by gamefish species.},

  abstract = {Systematic conservation planning applications based solely on the presence/absence of a large number of species are not sufficient to guarantee their persistence in highly fragmented landscapes. Recent developments have thus incorporated much desired spatial design considerations, and reserve-network connectivity has received increased attention. Nonetheless, connectivity is often determined without regard to species-specific responses to habitat fragmentation. But species differ in their dispersal ability and habitat requirements, making proximate priority areas necessary for some species, while undesirable for others. We present a novel approach that incorporates species-specific connectivity needs in reservenetwork design. Importantly, our method differs from previous approaches in that connectivity is not part of the objective function, but part of the constraints, thus avoiding typical undesirable trade-off that may result in high connectivity for some species but null connectivity for others. We use graphs to describe the dispersal pattern of each species and our goal is to identify minimum sets of reserves with connected sites for each of the species. This is not a trivial problem and we present three algorithms, one heuristic and two integer cutting algorithms that guarantee optimality, based on different 0\textendash{}1 linear programming formulations. Applications to simulated data show that one of the algorithms that guarantee optimality is superior to the other, although both have limited application due to the number of sites and species they can manage. Remarkably, the heuristic can obtain very satisfactory solutions in short computational times, surpassing the limitations of the exact algorithms.},

We explored differing scenarios of increased water-use efficiency (WUE) due to CO2-fertilisation, which we simulated as increased effective precipitation. In our forecasts: (1) climate change negatively impacted forest growth rates in the interior west and positively impacted forest growth along the western, southeastern and northeastern coasts; (2) shifting climate sensitivities offset positive effects of warming on high-latitude forests, leaving no evidence for continued `boreal greening'; and (3) it took a 72\% WUE enhancement to compensate for continentally averaged growth declines under RCP 8.5. Our results highlight the importance of locally adapted forest management strategies to handle regional differences in growth responses to climate change.},

Furthermore, this relationship emerged because there was a strong relationship between productivity and pond-to-pond species compositional differences. Alternatively, in watersheds where ponds were relatively close together (likely leading to higher rates of dispersal of many organisms), we found no scale-dependence; diversity was a hump-shaped function of productivity at both local and regional scales. Here, the relationship between species compositional dissimilarity and productivity was much weaker.

  abstract = {Boreal mixedwoods (BMWs) are the most productive and diverse forest ecosystems in North American boreal forests. A good understanding of BMW stand dynamics is a prerequisite for sustainable management of these vital resources. In this review, we describe the patterns and processes of BMWs created by natural disturbances, examine the biotic and abiotic factors that influence these patterns and processes, and discuss forest management implications related to stand development. Based on distinct structural and developmental features, BMW stand development is characterized by four stages: stand initiation, stem exclusion, canopy transition, and gap dynamics. These four stages of stand development provide a conceptual model of complex developmental processes. However, multiple pathways are possible during BMW stand development depending on disturbances, neighbour effects, and stand condition. Boreal mixedwood management at the stand level needs to emulate the natural development process and target a specific stand structure and species composition. Alternative silvicultural techniques are available to achieve the multiple objectives of BMWs. Further considerations at various temporal and spatial scales and at the operational level are required to ensure sustainable BMW management.},

Using a meta-analysis, we estimated that the distributions of species have recently shifted to higher elevations at a median rate of 11.0 meters per decade, and to higher latitudes at a median rate of 16.9 kilometers per decade. These rates are approximately two and three times faster than previously reported. The distances moved by species are greatest in studies showing the highest levels of warming, with average latitudinal shifts being generally sufficient to track temperature changes. However, individual species vary greatly in their rates of change, suggesting that the range shift of each species depends on multiple internal species traits and external drivers of change. Rapid average shifts derive from a wide diversity of responses by individual species.
A meta-analysis shows that species are shifting their distributions in response to climate change at an accelerating rate.

We studied 94 upland boreal forest stands between 5 and 18 years after fire in Ontario, Canada. Postfire species-specific regeneration density was positively related to prefire stand basal area for Pinus banksiana, Populus spp., Betula papyrifera and Picea mariana, but not for Picea glauca and Abies balsamea. In addition, seedling density of Populus spp., B. papyrifera, P. mariana, P. glauca and A. balsamea were positively affected by build up index and, except Populus spp., their density increased with age of burn. To facilitate testing the DRH, we introduced a term called compositional difference (CD) that is the difference in a species relative percentage between the postfire and prefire stand. The testable null hypothesis is CD = 0 for a given species. CD was not different from 0 for P. banksiana, was 19.8\% for Populus spp., 10.4\% for B. papyrifera, {\`A}17.9\% for P. mariana, {\`A}14.6\% for P. glauca, and {\`A}14.9\% for A. balsamea, indicating fire increases broadleaves at the expenses of mid- and latesuccessional coniferous species. Compositional increases of Populus spp. and B. papyrifera in postfire stands occurred mostly where these species were a minor component prior to fire. In conclusion, the DRH was supported by the specific positive relationships between postfire regeneration densities and prefire basal area for P. banksiana, Populus spp., B. papyrifera and P. mariana. However, if the DRH is used for predicting postfire composition, P. banksiana is the only species that had the same composition between postfire and prefire stands. Nevertheless, CD for P. banksiana was negatively related to its prefire composition. Similarly, CD for other species was negatively related to their prefire compositions with varying effects of build up index and age of burn. Our results suggest, if fire occurrences increase with global change, the boreal landscape will be more dominated by hardwoods and mixtures of conifers and hardwoods.},

  abstract = {Scale transition theory is an approach to understanding population and community dynamics in the presence of spatial or temporal variation in environmental factors or population densities. It focuses on changes in the equations for population dynamics as the scale enlarges. These changes are explained in terms of interactions between nonlinearities and variation on lower scales, and they predict the emergence of new properties on larger scales that are not predicted by lower scale dynamics in the absence of variation on those lower scales. These phenomena can be understood in terms of statistical inequalities arising from the process of nonlinear averaging, which translates the rules for dynamics from lower to higher scales. Nonlinearities in population dynamics are expressions of the fundamental biology of the interactions between individual organisms. Variation that interacts with these nonlinearities also involves biology fundamentally in several different ways. First, there are the aspects of biology that are sensitive to variation in space or time. These determine which aspects of a nonlinear dynamical equation are affected by variation, and whether different individuals or different species are sensitive to different extents or to different aspects of variation. Second is the nature of the variation, for example, whether it is variation in the physical environment or variation in population densities. From the interplay between variation and nonlinearities in population dynamics, scale transition theory builds a theory of changes in dynamics with changes in scale. In this article, the focus is on spatial variation, and the theory is illustrated with examples relevant to the dynamics of insect communities. In these communities, one commonly occurring nonlinear relationship is a negative exponential relationship between survival of an organism and the densities of natural enemies or competitors. This negative exponential has a biological origin in terms of independent actions of many individuals. The subsequent effects of spatial variation can be represented naturally in terms of Laplace transforms and related statistical transforms to obtain both analytical solutions and an extra level of understanding. This process allows us to analyze the meaning and effects of aggregation of insects in space. Scale transition theory more generally, however, does not aim to have fully analytical solutions but partial analytical solutions applicable for circumstances too complex for full analytical solution. These partial solutions are intended to provide a framework for understanding of numerical solutions, simulations and field studies where key quantities can be estimated from empirical data.},

  abstract = {Marine fishes and invertebrates respond to ocean warming through distribution shifts, generally to higher latitudes and deeper waters. Consequently, fisheries should be affected by `tropicalization' of catch1,2,3,4 (increasing dominance of warm-water species). However, a signature of such climate-change effects on global fisheries catch has so far not been detected. Here we report such an index, the mean temperature of the catch (MTC), that is calculated from the average inferred temperature preference of exploited species weighted by their annual catch. Our results show that, after accounting for the effects of fishing and large-scale oceanographic variability, global MTC increased at a rate of 0.19 degrees Celsius per decade between 1970 and 2006, and non-tropical MTC increased at a rate of 0.23 degrees Celsius per decade. In tropical areas, MTC increased initially because of the reduction in the proportion of subtropical species catches, but subsequently stabilized as scope for further tropicalization of communities became limited. Changes in MTC in 52 large marine ecosystems, covering the majority of the world's coastal and shelf areas, are significantly and positively related to regional changes in sea surface temperature5. This study shows that ocean warming has already affected global fisheries in the past four decades, highlighting the immediate need to develop adaptation plans to minimize the effect of such warming on the economy and food security of coastal communities, particularly in tropical regions6,7.},

The objectives of this study were to examine these relationships as influenced by light environment and test whether sensitivity to nutrient stress is mediated by oxidative stress. First-year sugar maple and red seedlings were grown on forest soil cores contrasting in nutrient availability under high or low light intensity. Foliar nutrition, photosynthesis, growth and antioxidant enzyme activity were assessed. Photosynthesis and growth of sugar maple were significantly lower on nutrient-poor soils and were correlated with leaf nutrient status with Ca and P having the strongest influence. For red maple, only chlorophyll content showed sensitivity to the nutrient-poor soils. High light exacerbated the negative effects of nutrient imbalances on photosynthesis and growth in sugar maple. Antioxidant enzyme activity in sugar maple was highest in seedlings growing on nutrient-poor soils and was inversely correlated with photosynthesis, Ca, P, and Mg concentrations. These results suggest that: (1) sugar maple is more sensitive to nutrient stresses associated with low pH soils than red maple; (2) high light increases sugar maple sensitivity to nutrient stress; (3) the negative effects of nutrient imbalances on sugar maple may be mediated by oxidative stress.},

One popular approach is the search for early warning signals (EWSs) based on alternative stable states theory. In this review, we cover the theory behind nonlinearity in dynamic systems and techniques to detect the loss of resilience that can indicate state transitions. We describe the research done on generic abundance-based signals of instability that are derived from the phenomenon of critical slowing down, which represent the genesis of EWSs research. We highlight some of the issues facing the detection of such signals in biological systems \textendash{} which are inherently complex and show low signal-to-noise ratios. We then document research on alternative signals of instability, including measuring shifts in spatial autocorrelation and trait dynamics, and discuss potential future directions for EWSs research based on detailed demographic and phenotypic data. We set EWSs research in the greater field of predictive ecology and weigh up the costs and benefits of simplicity vs. complexity in predictive models, and how the available data should steer the development of future methods. Finally, we identify some key unanswered questions that, if solved, could improve the applicability of these methods.},

Predicting stand dynamics and future yields in mixed-species complex structured stands cannot be easily accomplished with traditional field experiments. We outline the development and structure of SORTIE/BC, a descendent of the SORTIE model. SORTIE/BC is a light-mediated, spatially explicit, mixed-species forest model that makes population dynamic forecasts for juvenile and adult trees. We use the model to simulate partial cutting prescriptions in temperate deciduous, boreal and temperate coniferous mixed-species forests. The species, amount and spatial pattern of canopy tree removal had a major influence on understory light environments. Low and uniform removal of canopy trees were less successful in favouring the growth and survival of regenerating trees of intermediate to shade intolerant species and the growth of retained canopy trees than patch removal. In the boreal mixedwood, strip-cutting can maintain mixed stands but careful attention must be paid to buffer and strip management to optimize stand growth. We conclude that SORTIE/BC can be very useful to explore and explain the silvicultural implications of complex silvicultural prescriptions for which there are no existing long-term experiments.},

  abstract = {The growth and survival of ten hardwood tree species, planted in abandoned fields in southern Quebec, over a range of soil and geological conditions, were analyzed in order to identify optimal site conditions for species growth. From a total of 23 experimental blocks, in which a total of 5750 seedlings was planted, we described six different soil types based on a cluster analysis of 12 soil variables. Factorial analysis linked species growth, in height and diameter, to gradients of soil nutrient richness and soil moisture. A statistical indicator of the degree of specificity of species toward soil variables was obtained by Kaiser's measure of sampling adequacy (Kaiser, 1970. Little jiffy, mark IV. Educational and Psychological Measurement 34, 11 l-1 17). After four growing seasons, heights of red ash, red oak and bur oak are markedly different among soil types. Best red ash growth occurred on the most nutrient-rich and humid soils, as opposed to red oak whose best growth occurred at the nutrient-poor and dry endpoints of the edaphic gradients. Bur oak differs from red oak in having good growth over a wide range of soil moisture conditions. Sugar maple growth was best on well drained and relatively nutrient-rich soils, but had high within-site variability. Yellow birch, with a low overall survival, attained its best growth in the most nutrient-poor, as well as above-average soil moisture conditions. The optimal edaphic conditions are weakly defined in the case of bittemut hickory and black walnut, the largest size of which was attained in below-average and in better-than-average soil nutrient conditions respectively, Silver maple performed equally well on the majority of soil types, but achieved exceptional growth on the wettest soil type. White ash and butternut growth also suggest a wide ecological amplitude, the first having good growth and the second having slow growth on all soil types. A synthesis of the experimental results is presented as a decisional chart for silviculturalists. Soil texture, moisture and pH are ordered according to their potential for the optimal growth of species. Identified geological, geomorphologic and pedological site constraints on species growth must be considered in the species selection process, especially for species which attain their best growth in narrower segments of the edaphic gradients. 0 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {Understanding tree recruitment dynamics in various growth environments is essential for a better assessment of tree species' adaptive capacity to climate change. We investigated the microsite factors influencing survival, growth, and foliar nutrition of natural and planted sugar maple seedlings (Acer saccharum) along a gradient of tree species that reflect the change in composition from temperate hardwoods to boreal forests of eastern Canada. We specifically tested whether the increasing abundance of conifers in the forest and its modifications on soil properties negatively affects foliar nutrition of natural seedlings as well as the survival and growth of seedlings planted directly in the natural soil and in pots filled with enriched soil. Results of natural seedlings indicate that under conifer-dominated stands, lower soil pH, accelerated dissolution of some minerals, lower temperature and moisture, and higher levels of phenolic compounds have created microsites that are less suitable for sugar maple foliar nutrition and regeneration. These conditions were omnipresent under hemlock. The growth of seedlings planted in the natural soil was negatively impacted by the overall low soil quality under all forest types (as compared to seedlings planted in pots with enriched soil). However, survival and growth of the seedlings were not negatively affected by conifers, regardless of planting type, likely because of stored nutrients from the nursery. Also, lower survival was found under maple\textendash{}birch stands for seedlings planted both in the natural soil and in pots with enriched soil due to higher shading. This study has identified key microsite factors created by specific conifers that may impede or benefit the potential of sugar maple to maintain its current range or expand its range northward under climate change.},

  abstract = {Background: The first three censuses of the 50-ha plot at Barro Colorado Island spanned an unusually harsh dry season during the 1983 El Ni{\~n}o. By the early 1990s, we had documented increases in tree mortality, tree growth, and large population fluctuations of many species during the 1982\textendash{}1985 census interval. At the time, we asserted that increasing drought frequency would greatly affect the forest. With the benefit of five more censuses at Barro Colorado from 1995\textendash{}2015, we can now put the 1980 conditions in a longer perspective and test the hypothesis that increasing droughtiness has continued to change the forest.
Methods: A 50-ha forest plot on Barro Colorado Island was censused eight times, in 1982 and every five years since 1985. All free-standing woody stems were measured, mapped, and identified in each census.
Results: 1) The period 1982\textendash{}1992 included several extreme dry seasons, not just 1983, but since then there have been few such droughts. 2) Dbh growth declined from a peak in the early 1980s to its lowest in the early 1990s. From 1995\textendash{}2015 it increased slightly, but not returning to the initial peak. Nearly every species and all dbh categories followed the same pattern. 3) The elevated stand-wide mortality rate of large trees during the 1982\textendash{}1985 drought has not returned, and most individual species showed the same pattern of elevated mortality in the 1980s followed by low and fairly stable mortality after 1990. 4) Sapling mortality declined after 1985, but rose again in the late-90s, so the 1980s drought period no longer looks unusual. Mortality of individual species' saplings fluctuated erratically, including cases where mortality during the drought was lower than after. 5) Population sizes of individual species fluctuated in all possible directions. Some species declined precipitously during the drought, then recovered, but others did not recover. Other species increased in abundance during the drought.
Conclusions: Droughts of the 1980s elevated tree growth and mortality at Barro Colorado, but since 1990, demographic rates have remained lower, paralleling a moderate climate with few severe droughts after 1990. Moisture-demanding species suffered during the drought, but many have since recovered. We do not know how often such drought periods recur. Moreover, many species' abundances fluctuated over 35 years with no known cause.},

  abstract = {Climate change is causing widespread geographical range shifts, which likely reflects different processes at leading and trailing range margins. Progressive warming is thought to relax thermal barriers at poleward range margins, enabling colonization of novel areas, but imposes increasingly unsuitable thermal conditions at equatorward margins, leading to range losses from those areas. Few tests of this process during recent climate change have been possible, but understanding determinants of species' range limits will improve predictions of their geographical responses to climate change and variation in extinction risk. Here, we examine the relationship between poleward and equatorward range margin dynamics with respect to temperature-related geographical limits observed for 34 breeding passerine species in North America between 1984\textendash{}1988 and 2002\textendash{}2006. We find that species' equatorward range margins were closer to their upper realized thermal niche limits and proximity to those limits predicts equatorward population extinction risk through time. Conversely, the difference between breeding bird species' poleward range margin temperatures and the coolest temperatures they tolerate elsewhere in their ranges was substantial and remained consistent through time: range expansion at species' poleward range margins is unlikely to directly reflect lowered thermal barriers to colonization. The process of range expansion may reflect more complex factors operating across broader areas of species' ranges. The latitudinal extent of breeding bird ranges is decreasing through time. Disparate responses observed at poleward versus equatorward margins arise due to differences in range margin placement within the realized thermal niche and suggest that climate-induced geographical shift at equatorward range limits more strongly reflect abiotic conditions than at their poleward range limits. This further suggests that observed geographic responses to date may fail to demonstrate the true cost of climate change on the poleward portion of species' distributions. Poleward range margins for North American breeding passerines are not presently in equilibrium with realized thermal limits.},

  abstract = {Bird population dynamics are expected to change in response to increased weather variability, an expression of climate change. The extent to which species are sensitive to effects of weather on survival and reproduction depends on their life-history traits. We investigated how breeding bird species can be grouped, based on their life-history traits and according to weather-correlated population dynamics. We developed and applied the linear trait \textendash{}environment method (LTE), which is a modified version of the fourth-corner method. Despite our focus on single traits, 2 strategies \textemdash{}combinations of several traits \textemdash{} stand out. As expected, breeding populations of waterfowl species are negatively impacted by severe winters directly preceding territory monitoring, probably because of increased adult mortality. Waterfowl species combine several traits: they often breed at ground or water level, feed on plant material, are precocial and are generally short-distance or partial migrants. Furthermore, we found a decline in population growth rates of insectivorous long-distance migrants due to mild winters and warm springs in the year before territory monitoring, which may be caused by reduced reproduction due to trophic mismatches. We identify species that are expected to show the most significant responses to changing weather variability, assuming that our conclusions are based on causal relationships and that the way species, weather variables and habitat interact will not alter. Species expected to respond positively can again be roughly categorized as waterfowl species, while insectivorous long-distance migrants are mostly expected to respond negatively. As species traits play an important role in constructing functional groups that are relevant to the provisioning of ecosystem services, our study enables the incorporation of ecosystem vulnerability to climate change into such functional approaches.},

The survival probability of: white/Engelmann spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss/Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm.), black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP.), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas ex Loudon), jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.), trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.), and balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) was modeled using tree size (dbh), competition estimates (basal area of the larger trees by species group), climate normal, tagging limits and the time elapsed between consecutive measurements. Survival increased nonlinearly with tree size and the effect of competition on tree survival was related to the shade-tolerance of the species and to stand composition, with shade intolerant conifer species (i.e. lodgepole and jack pine) being more negatively affected by competition compared to shade intolerant deciduous species (trembling aspen and balsam poplar) and shade tolerant spruce species (white and black spruce). Competition from larger spruce (Picea spp.), fir (Abies spp.) and deciduous species (e.g. Populus spp. and Betula spp.) had stronger influences on survival than pine species (Pinus spp.). Intraspecific competition also had significant effects on survival of the majority of the species. Climate Moisture Index provided better results than other climate variables for most species and survival probability increased with increasing values of CMI (i.e. relatively cooler and wetter climate), while for pine species survival probability decreased with increasing CMI and showed higher levels of survival on warmer and drier sites for the range of conditions included in our data. The predictive equations developed in this study could be used to improve the predictive ability of existing growth and yield models such as the Mixedwood Growth Model.},

  abstract = {In the North American boreal forest, the adoption of forest ecosystem management strategies usually increases the number of forest stands to be treated with irregular or uneven-aged silvicultural systems. However, it is difficult to properly target the stands most appropriate for partial cut treatments in remote areas where road access is limited, because current inventory data do not include an assessment of key stand characteristics for silvicultural prescriptions, such as the abundance of small stems in the understory. In this study, we present a forest classification performed using classification and ordination methods, based on ground-measured structural and compositional stand characteristics, in a region of eastern Qu{\'e}bec, Canada. This classification resulted in six forest types, which range in composition and structure from relatively regular post-fire stands dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana) to relatively irregular stands co-dominated by balsam fir (Abies balsamea) and black spruce. This classification was linked with cartographic information currently available to forest managers. Information from a fine-scale forest map predicted slightly better the presence of forest types with irregular stand structures compared with a coarse-scale forest map complemented with a fire map. Thus, areas most suitable for the implementation of uneven-aged silvicultural systems can be roughly delineated from existing cartographic information, which will facilitate their integration into large-scale and long-term forest management plans.},

However, accounting for these uncertainties is a difficult task, since ecology is known for its complexity. Measurement and/or process errors are often the only sources of uncertainty modeled when addressing complex ecological problems, yet analyses should also account for uncertainty in sampling design, in model specification, in parameters governing the specified model, and in initial and boundary conditions. Only then can we be confident in the scientific inferences and forecasts made from an analysis. Probability and statistics provide a framework that accounts for multiple sources of uncertainty. Given the complexities of ecological studies, the hierarchical statistical model is an invaluable tool. This approach is not new in ecology, and there are many examples (both Bayesian and non-Bayesian) in the literature illustrating the benefits of this approach. In this article, we provide a baseline for concepts, notation, and methods, from which discussion on hierarchical statistical modeling in ecology can proceed. We have also planted some seeds for discussion and tried to show where the practical difficulties lie. Our thesis is that hierarchical statistical modeling is a powerful way of approaching ecological analysis in the presence of inevitable but quantifiable uncertainties, even if practical issues sometimes require pragmatic compromises.},

  abstract = {Two determinants of fire behavior are fire weather and spatial variation in fuels. Their relative importance in boreal forests has been unclear. I evaluated the effect of fuels on a {$\sim$}74 000-km2 landscape in the boreal mixedwood region of western Canada. My data were the compositions, or the proportional areas of different forest types, of 48 mapped lightning fires and of their immediate surroundings. I measured areal compositions from forest inventory maps, using a five-way classification representing deciduous forest, three types of coniferous forest, and wetlands. The fires burned between 1980 and 1993. Fire sizes ranged from 70 ha to 70 000 ha. By multivariate linear regression, fire surroundings explain 57\% of the variation in forest types within mapped fires. Fire compositions are not representative of the study area as a whole, or of a fire's surroundings, and are unrelated to fire size and location within the study area. Using the model, I predicted the areas of the five types burned within all other lightning fires {$>$}200 ha in the study area during 1961\textendash{}1996 and estimated type-specific mean annual burn rates. These rates vary by an order of magnitude. Deciduous stands burn at the lowest rate, and black spruce stands burn at the highest rate. Fires exhibit significant preferences between forest types at both local and regional scales. Preference orderings are similar at both scales and are generally consistent with the rank order of estimated burn rates. Preferential burning may result from between-class differences in vertical canopy structure and foliage characteristics. The statistical model and the postulated variations in fire behavior between classes indicate that landscape-scale fuels management may be feasible in this system. The rank ordering of burning frequencies and preferences is the inverse of the planned disturbance rates under forest management.},

We evaluated the degree to which predicted connected habitat for each of 144 different hypothetical organisms expressing range of dispersal abilities and ecological responses to elevation, roads and land cover function as an indicators of connected habitat for the others in the U.S. Northern Rocky Mountains. We used resistant kernel modeling to map the extent of the study area predicted to be connected by dispersal for each species. At relatively large dispersal abilities there was extensive overlap between connected habitat for most organisms and much of the study area is predicted to provide connected habitat for all hypothetical organisms simultaneously. In contrast, at low to medium dispersal abilities there was much less intersection of habitat connected by dispersal. We found that habitat specialists with limited dispersal ability are weak indicators of others, and likewise are weakly indicated by others. We evaluated the effectiveness of three carnivores as connectivity umbrellas for many species. All three carnivore species performed significantly worse as connectivity umbrellas than the average across the simulated species. These species are associated with high elevation forested habitats. It is the low elevation and non-forest habitats that are most at risk of habitat loss and fragmentation in the study area, suggesting that a carnivore umbrella may miss many species most at risk.},

It is therefore often suggested that the impacts of anthropogenic disturbances (eg logging) on a managed landscape are attenuated if the patterns and processes created by these events resemble those of natural disturbances (eg fire). To provide forest management guidelines, we investigate the long-term variability in the mean fire interval (MFI) of a boreal landscape in eastern North America, as reconstructed from lacustrine (lake-associated) sedimentary charcoal. We translate the natural variability in MFI into a range of landscape age structures, using a simple modeling approach. Although using the array of possible forest age structures provides managers with some flexibility, an assessment of the current state of the landscape suggests that logging has already caused a shift in the age-class distribution toward a stronger representation of young stands with a concurrent decrease in old-growth stands. Logging is indeed quickly forcing the studied landscape outside of its long-term natural range of variability, implying that substantial changes in management practices are required, if we collectively decide to maintain these fundamental attributes of the boreal forest.},

However, little is known about the compatibility of these two objectives or the long-term efficacy of a given management regime at simultaneously achieving adaptation and mitigation. To address this need, we examined stand-level carbon and complexity responses using five long-term ({$>$}50 yrs) silviculture experiments within the upper Great Lakes region, USA. In particular, live tree carbon stores and sequestration rates, and compositional and structural complexity were analyzed from three thinning experiments in Pinus resinosa and two selection method experiments in northern hardwood systems to elucidate the longterm effects of management on these ecosystem attributes and the general compatibility of mitigation and adaptation objectives.},

As climate-driven range dynamics should diminish local adaptations and favor generalization, one hypothesis is that contemporary biotic specialization is determined by the degree of past climatic instability, primarily Quaternary climate-change velocity. Other prominent hypotheses predict that either contemporary climate or species richness affect biotic specialization. To gain insight into geographical patterns of contemporary biotic specialization and its drivers, we use network analysis to determine the degree of specialization in plant-hummingbird mutualistic networks sampled at 31 localities, spanning a wide range of climate regimes across the Americas. We found greater biotic specialization at lower latitudes, with latitude explaining 20\textendash{}22\% of the spatial variation in plant-hummingbird specialization. Potential drivers of specialization - contemporary climate, Quaternary climate-change velocity, and species richness - had superior explanatory power, together explaining 53\textendash{}64\% of the variation in specialization. Notably, our data provides empirical evidence for the hypothesized roles of species richness, contemporary precipitation and Quaternary climate-change velocity as key predictors of biotic specialization, whereas contemporary temperature and seasonality seem unimportant in determining specialization. These results suggest that both ecological and evolutionary processes at Quaternary time scales can be important in driving large-scale geographical patterns of contemporary biotic specialization, at least for co-evolved systems such as plant-hummingbird networks.},

  abstract = {Cold air drainage and pooling occur in many mountain valleys, especially at night and during winter. Local climate regimes associated with frequent cold air pooling have substantial impacts on species phenology, distribution and diversity. However, little is known about how the degree and frequency of cold air drainage and pooling will respond to a changing climate. Evidence suggests that, because cold pools are decoupled from the free atmosphere, these local climates may not respond in the same way as regional-scale climates estimated from coarse-grid general circulation models. Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated that historical changes in the frequency of synoptic conditions have produced complex spatial variations in the resulting climatic changes on the ground. In the mountainous terrain of the Oregon Cascades, we show that, at relatively exposed hill slope and ridge top locations, air temperatures are highly coupled to changes in synoptic circulation patterns at the 700-hPa level, whereas in sheltered valley bottoms, cold air pooling at night and during winter causes temperatures to be largely decoupled from, and relatively insensitive to, 700-hPa flow variations. The result is a complex temperature landscape composed of steep gradients in temporal variation, controlled largely by gradients in elevation and topographic position. When a projected climate warming of 2.5 \textdegree{}C was combined with likely changes in the frequency distribution of synoptic circulation, modelled temperature changes at closely spaced locations diverged widely (by up to 6 \textdegree{}C), with differences equalling or exceeding that of the imposed regional temperature change. Because cold air pooling and consequent atmospheric decoupling occur in many mountain valleys, especially at high latitudes, this phenomenon is likely to be an important consideration in understanding the impacts of climate change in mountainous regions.

  abstract = {1 Boundaries between forest and tundra ecosystems, tree lines, are expected to advance in altitude and latitude in response to climate warming. However, varied responses to 20th century warming suggest that in addition to temperature, tree line dynamics are mediated by species-specific traits and environmental conditions at landscape and local scales. 2 We examined recent tree line dynamics at six topographically different, but climatically similar, sites in south-west Yukon, Canada. Dendroecological techniques were used to reconstruct changes in density of the dominant tree species, white spruce (Picea glauca), and to construct static age distributions of willow (Salix spp.), one of two dominant shrub genera. Data were analysed to identify periods and rates of establishment and mortality and to relate these to past climate. 3 Tree line elevation and stand density increased significantly during the early to mid 20th century. However, this change was not uniform across sites. Spruce advanced rapidly on south-facing slopes and tree line rose 65\textendash{}85 m in elevation. Tree line did not advance on north-facing slopes, but stand density increased 40\textendash{}65\%. Differences observed between aspects were due primarily to the differential presence of permafrost. Additional variability among sites was related to slope and vegetation type. Results were less conclusive for willow, but evidence for an advance was found at two sites. 4 Increases in stand density were strongly correlated with summer temperatures. The period of rapid change coincided with a 30-year period of above average temperatures, beginning in 1920. The highest correlations were obtained using a forward average of 30\textendash{}50 years, supporting the hypothesis that tree line dynamics are controlled more by conditions influencing recruitment than by establishment alone. 5 The changes observed at several sites are suggestive of a threshold response and challenge the notion that tree lines respond gradually to climate warming. Overall, the results provide further evidence to support the idea that the pattern and timing of change is contingent on local, landscape, and regional-scale factors, as well as species' biology.},

  abstract = {In an effort to ensure the sustainability of their forests, boreal forest managers often use forest planning models to make future projections of timber supply and other key services, such as habitat for wildlife. Projecting the fate of these services has proven to be challenging, however, as major uncertainties exist regarding the principal drivers of boreal ecosystem dynamics, including the future spatial and temporal distribution of wildfire and timber harvesting. Existing forest planning models are not well suited to dealing with this uncertainty because they produce deterministic projections based on central tendencies of these drivers. Here we present a new approach for incorporating uncertainty into forest management planning, which we demonstrate using two landscapes in the Canadian boreal forest. Our approach takes the assumptions contained within the latest forest management plans for each of these landscapes, including parameterizations of their deterministic forest planning models, and converts these assumptions into equivalent parameterizations of a stochastic, spatially-explicit state-and-transition simulation model (STSM). We then use Monte Carlo simulations with the STSM to ``stress-test'' the forest management plan with respect to a range of possible future uncertainties, including uncertainties in future levels and patterns of wildfire and timber harvest, along with the possible changes in wildfire that might result from future climate change. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of incorporating stochastic variability into projections of future ecosystem condition. The STSM projections that acknowledged variability in wildfire and timber harvest differed from the deterministic forest planning model projections that were based solely on mean values. Our analysis also suggests that there is an increased risk of shortfalls in timber harvest, for both boreal landscapes, associated with future projections for changes in wildfire due to climate change, and that management strategies aimed at reducing the future level of timber harvest offer an opportunity to mitigate these risks. We believe our approach provides a new risk-based framework for incorporating uncertainty into forest management, including the effects of climate change.},

  abstract = {Methods We used a reconstruction of pre-industrial tree communities based on historical land survey records (1854\textendash{}1935), together with modern data, to assess changes in tree b-diversity patterns. Then, bdiversity was partitioned into fractions explained by spatial (dbMEM) and environmental variables (latitude, elevation, slope, drainage and surface deposits) in order to assess changes in spatial structures and community-environment relationships.
Results In pre-industrial times, environmental variables explained only a small proportion of b-diversity since dominant taxa were present across the range of environmental gradients, whereas habitat specialists were very rare. Between pre-industrial and modern times, our analysis highlights an increase in bdiversity and the proportion of b-diversity that was explained by environmental variables. Increased disturbance rates have favored early-successional habitat specialist taxa and reduced the habitat breadth of preindustrial generalists, thereby increasing the strength of community-environment relationships.
Conclusions Our results support that disturbance can alter the strength of community-environment relationships and also suggest that functional traits of species within the regional pool could predict whether or not disturbance alters such relationships.},

  abstract = {Land use changes that are linked to European settlement of North America have transformed northeastern temperate forest landscapes. Many studies report a regional increase of young early-successional forests due to high disturbance rates since the preindustrial era (fire, land clearing, and clear-cuts). In this study, we document specific compositional changes to presentday mature forest landscapes, which have only been managed with partial cutting (high-grading and diameter-limit cuts) since the preindustrial era in southwestern Quebec. We resurveyed 108 forest observations that were extracted from logbooks of former logging concession limits (surveyed between 1870 and 1890). Results highlight an increase in mid- to late-successional shade-tolerant taxa (Betula alleghaniensis Britton, Thuja occidentalis L., Acer saccharum Marsh.) at the expense of preindustrial dominant conifers (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill., Pinus strobus L.). Former logging activities and spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana Clemens) outbreaks appear to be the main drivers of these changes, which were also strongly structured across the topographic gradient. To some extent, these results highlight the relevance of partial cutting management, as it has allowed long-term maintenance of a mid- to late-successional forest composition, while also pointing the need for P. strobus restoration. We conclude that by allowing site-specific comparisons, the resurvey of historical observations greatly improve the analytical strengths of historical reconstruction.},

To shed light on factors contributing to background tree mortality, we analyzed detailed pathological data from 200,668 tree-y\- ears of observation and 3,729 individual tree deaths, recorded over a 13-y\- r period in a network of old-growth forest plots in California's Sierra Nevada mountain range. We found that: (1) Biotic mortality factors (mostly insects and pathogens) dominated (58\%), particularly in larger trees (86\%). Bark beetles were the most prevalent (40\%), even though there were no outbreaks during the study period; in contrast, the contribution of defoliators was negligible. (2) Relative occurrences of broad classes of mortality factors (biotic, 58\%; suppression, 51\%; and mechanical, 25\%) are similar among tree taxa, but may vary with tree size and growth rate. (3) We found little evidence of distinct groups of mortality factors that predictably occur together on trees. Our results have at least three sets of implications. First, rather than being driven by abiotic factors such as lightning or windstorms, the ``ambient'' or ``random'' background mortality that many forest models presume to be i\-ndependent of tree growth rate is instead dominated by biotic agents of tree mortality, with potentially critical implications for forecasting future mortality. Mechanistic models of background mortality, even for healthy, rapidly growing trees, must therefore include the insects and pathogens that kill trees. Second, the biotic agents of tree mortality, instead of occurring in a few predictable combinations, may generally act opportunistically and with a relatively large degree of independence from one another. Finally, beyond the current emphasis on folivory and leaf defenses, studies of broad-s\-cale gradients in the nature and strength of biotic i\-nteractions should also include biotic attacks on, and defenses of, tree stems and roots.},

The splits are chosen to minimize the dissimilarity of sites within clusters. The measure of species dissimilarity can be selected by the user, and hence MRT can be used to relate any aspect of species composition to environmental data. The clusters and their dependence on the environmental data are represented graphically by a tree. Each cluster also represents a species assemblage, and its environmental values define its associated habitat. MRT can be used to analyze complex ecological data that may include imbalance, missing values, nonlinear relationships between variables, and high-order interactions. They can also predict species composition at sites for which only environmental data are available.

The abstraction of ecological systems \textendash{} such as communities \textendash{} through networks of interactions between their components indeed provides a way to summarize this information with single objects. The methodological framework derived from graph theory also provides numerous approaches and measures to analyze these objects and can offer new perspectives on established ecological theories as well as tools to address new challenges. However, prior to using these methods to test ecological hypotheses, it is necessary that we understand, adapt, and use them in ways that both allow us to deliver their full potential and account for their limitations. Here, we attempt to increase the accessibility of network approaches by providing a review of the tools that have been developed so far, with \textendash{} what we believe to be \textendash{} their appropriate uses and potential limitations. This is not an exhaustive review of all methods and metrics, but rather, an overview of tools that are robust, informative, and ecologically sound. After providing a brief presentation of species interaction networks and how to build them in order to summarize ecological information of different types, we then classify methods and metrics by the types of ecological questions that they can be used to answer from global to local scales, including methods for hypothesis testing and future perspectives. Specifically, we show how the organization of species interactions in a community yields different network structures (e.g., more or less dense, modular or nested), how different measures can be used to describe and quantify these emerging structures, and how to compare communities based on these differences in structures. Within networks, we illustrate metrics that can be used to describe and compare the functional and dynamic roles of species based on their position in the network and the organization of their interactions as well as associated new methods to test the significance of these results. Lastly, we describe potential fruitful avenues for new methodological developments to address novel ecological questions.},

However, we know little about the long-term effects of such a severe weather event, or how its potential interaction with other biotic factors impacted tree mortality. In this study, we investigated the long-term influence of the 1998 ice storm on tree mortality in Bois{\'e}-des-Muir ecological reserve, an old-growth forest in southern Qu{\'e}bec (Canada). Mortality rates for four out of the five tree species studied showed a striking increase a few years after the ice storm, between 2000 and 2004. After this peak, tree mortality rates remained higher than before 1998. These results indicate a lagged and persistent effect of the ice storm on tree mortality and suggest that the tree community of Bois{\'e}-des-Muir was more severely impacted than previously reported. Tree species were differentially damaged by the ice storm, and more than 25\% of all tree species lost more than half their crown. Using a Cox proportional hazard model, we evaluated the impact of different levels of initial canopy damage from the ice storm on long-term tree mortality while taking into account other important biotic factors, such as tree size, tree density, indices of species-specific competition, and the presence of the beech scale insect. Species differed in their response to the storm, suggesting fundamental differences in sensitivity to extreme weather events. In particular, eastern hop-hornbeam (Ostrya virginiana) and American beech (Fagus grandifolia) were the species most vulnerable to the ice storm, and severe canopy loss led to a large increase in mortality risk. These findings suggest that the difference in tree survival following a natural disturbance likely depends not only on the severity of the damage itself, but also on species-specific ability to repair injuries and maintain physiological processes. We also found that tree size and species-specific competition influenced tree mortality significantly but did not interact with level of canopy loss. Consequently, multiple biotic factors remain important to explain mortality even after a major disturbance and should be considered when evaluating tree mortality. Our results show that the impact of the ice storm on tree mortality was species-specific, lagged and persisted for several years after the disturbance, potentially resulting in long-term compositional changes in the forest. This underscores the necessity of conducting long-term monitoring studies to understand the complete impacts of ice storms and other extreme climatic events on forests.},

Yet this process has hardly been quantified on a large scale through simple indices, and the connection between landscape disturbance and functional homogenization has hardly been established. Here we test whether changes in land use and landscape fragmentation are associated with functional homogenization of bird communities at a national scale. Location France. Methods We estimated functional homogenization of a community as the average specialization of the species present in that community. We studied the spatial variation of this community specialization index (CSI) using 1028 replicates from the French Breeding Bird Survey along spatial gradients of landscape fragmentation and recent landscape disturbance, measured independently, and accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Results The CSI was very sensitive to both measures of environmental degradation: on average, 23\% of the difference in the CSI values between two sample sites was attributed to the difference in fragmentation and the disturbance between sites. This negative correlation between CSI and sources of landscape degradation was consistent over various habitats and biogeographical zones. Main conclusions We demonstrate that the functional homogenization of bird communities is strongly positively correlated to landscape disturbance and fragmentation. We suggest that the CSI is particularly effective for measuring functional homogenization on both local and global scales for any sort of organism and with abundance or presence\textendash{}absence data.},

We investigated 13 covariates in four categories: climate, air pollutants, topography, and stand characteristics.

Current debate about the relative roles of niche-based and stochastic processes in shaping species distributions and community composition reflects, in part, the challenge of understanding how these processes interact across scales. Traditional statistical models that ignore autocorrelation and spatial hierarchies can result in misidentification of important ecological covariates. Here, we demonstrate the utility of a hierarchical modeling framework for testing hypotheses about the importance of abiotic factors at different spatial scales and local spatial autocorrelation for shaping species distributions and abundances. For the two orchid species studied, understory light availability and soil moisture helped to explain patterns of presence and abundance at a microsite scale ({$<$}4 m2), while soil organic content was important at a population scale ({$<$}400 m2). The inclusion of spatial autocorrelation is shown to alter the magnitude and certainty of estimated relationships between abundance and abiotic variables, and we suggest that such analysis be used more often to explore the relationships between species life histories and distributions. The hierarchical modeling framework is shown to have great potential for elucidating ecological relationships involving abiotic and biotic processes simultaneously at multiple scales.},

  abstract = {There is compelling evidence from glacial and interglacial periods of the Quaternary of the utilization of microrefugia. Microrefugia are sites that support locally favorable climates amidst unfavorable regional climates, which allow populations of species to persist outside of their main distributions. Knowledge of the location of microrefugia has important implications for climate change research as it will influence our understanding of the spatial distribution of species through time, their patterns of genetic diversity, and potential dispersal rates in response to climate shifts. Indeed, the implications of microrefugia are profound and yet we know surprisingly little about their climatic basis; what climatic processes can support their subsistence, where they may occur, their climatic traits, and the relevance of these locations for climate change research. Here I examine the climatic basis for microrefugia and assert that the interaction between regional advective influences and local terrain influences will define the distribution and nature of microrefugia. I review the climatic processes that can support their subsistence and from this climatic basis: (1) infer traits of the spatial distribution of microrefugia and how this may change through time; (2) review assertions about their landscape position and what it can tell us about regional climates; and (3) demonstrate an approach to forecasting where microrefugia may occur in the future.

Location The western Unites States. Methods Using data from the USDA Forest Inventory and Analysis programme, we compare the distribution of conspecific adult and juvenile trees for 62 western US tree species. We relate demographic niche differences to species traits including shade and drought tolerance. We model recruitment under projected climate change using generalized linear mixed models, probabilistic uncertainty accounting, forest structural data and projected changes in the climatic water balance. Results On average juveniles of western US tree species occupy a climatic subset of their conspecific adults. Demographic niche differences increase as species shade and drought tolerance increase and are greatest at climatic range margins, indicating the potential for range contractions. Models calibrated solely with climate data project recruitment declines for 2080 that are 47\% larger on average than models that also account for forest structure. Main conclusions Climate change-driven declines in recruitment in western US tree species may be partly offset by the moderating effect of forest canopies. The importance of this stabilizing process will depend on whether a given site is disturbed and the traits of resident species, including their ability to utilize sites that have buffered microclimates. Conversely, our results suggest that broad-scale disturbances which result in the loss of forest canopy will amplify the effects of climate change on tree recruitment.},

  abstract = {Afforestation is considered a cost-effective and readily available climate change mitigation option. In recent studies afforestation is presented as a major solution to limit climate change. However, estimates of afforestation potential vary widely. Moreover, the risks in global mitigation policy and the negative trade-offs with food security are often not considered. Here we present a new approach to assess the economic potential of afforestation with the IMAGE 3.0 integrated assessment model framework. In addition, we discuss the role of afforestation in mitigation pathways and the effects of afforestation on the food system under increasingly ambitious climate targets. We show that afforestation has a mitigation potential of 4.9 GtCO2/year at 200 US\$/tCO2 in 2050 leading to large-scale application in an SSP2 scenario aiming for 2\textdegree{}C (410 GtCO2 cumulative up to 2100). Afforestation reduces the overall costs of mitigation policy. However, it may lead to lower mitigation ambition and lock-in situations in other sectors. Moreover, it bears risks to implementation and permanence as the negative emissions are increasingly located in regions with high investment risks and weak governance, for example in Sub-Saharan Africa. Afforestation also requires large amounts of land (up to 1,100 Mha) leading to large reductions in agricultural land. The increased competition for land could lead to higher food prices and an increased population at risk of hunger. Our results confirm that afforestation has substantial potential for mitigation. At the same time, we highlight that major risks and trade-offs are involved. Pathways aiming to limit climate change to 2\textdegree{}C or even 1.5\textdegree{}C need to minimize these risks and trade-offs in order to achieve mitigation sustainably.},

But it is not yet clear how well BEF theory predicts outcomes of restoration, because it has been developed through tests involving short-run and tightly controlled (e.g., weeded) experiments. Thus, we resampled our 1997 BEF experiment in a restored salt marsh to test for long-term effects of species richness (plantings with 1, 3, and 6 species per 2 3 2 m plot), with multiple ecosystem functions as response variables. Over 11 years, 1- and 6-species assemblages converged on intermediate richness (mean {$\frac{1}{4}$} 3.9 species/ 0.25-m2 plot), and composition changed nonrandomly throughout the site. While three species became rare, the two most productive species became co-dominant. The two dominants controlled and increased shoot biomass, which appeared to decrease species richness. Diversity\textendash{}function relationships became less positive over 11 years and differed significantly with (a) the species-richness metric (planted vs. measured), and (b) the indicator of function (shoot biomass, height, and canopy layering). The loss of positive relationships between species richness and function in our restored site began soon after we stopped weeding and continued with increasing dominance by productive species. Where species-rich plantings are unlikely to ensure long-term restoration of functions, as in our salt marsh, we recommend dual efforts to establish (1) dominant species that provide high levels of target functions, and (2) subordinate species, which might provide additional functions under current or future conditions.},

  abstract = {Many analyses of ecological networks in recent years have introduced new indices to describe network properties. As a consequence, tens of indices are available to address similar questions, differing in specific detail, sensitivity in detecting the property in question, and robustness with respect to network size and sampling intensity. Furthermore, some indices merely reflect the number of species participating in a network, but not their interrelationship, requiring a null model approach. Here we introduce a new, free software calculating a large spectrum of network indices, visualizing bipartite networks and generating null models. We use this tool to explore the sensitivity of 26 network indices to network dimensions, sampling intensity and singleton observations. Based on observed data, we investigate the interrelationship of these indices, and show that they are highly correlated, and heavily influenced by network dimensions and connectance. Finally, we re-evaluate five common hypotheses about network properties, comparing 19 pollination networks with three differently complex null models: 1. The number of links per species (``degree'') follow (truncated) power law distributions. 2. Generalist pollinators interact with specialist plants, and vice versa (dependence asymmetry). 3. Ecological networks are nested. 4. Pollinators display complementarity, owing to specialization within the network. 5. Plant-pollinator networks are more robust to extinction than random networks. Our results indicate that while some hypotheses hold up against our null models, others are to a large extent understandable on the basis of network size, rather than ecological interrelationships. In particular, null model pattern of dependence asymmetry and robustness to extinction are opposite to what current network paradigms suggest.

  abstract = {Given the increasingly global stresses on forests, many ecologists argue that managers must maintain ecological resilience: the capacity of ecosystems to absorb disturbances without undergoing fundamental change. In this review we ask: Can the emerging paradigm of natural-disturbance-based management (NDBM) maintain ecological resilience in managed forests? Applying resilience theory requires careful articulation of the ecosystem state under consideration, the disturbances and stresses that affect the persistence of possible alternative states, and the spatial and temporal scales of management relevance. Implementing NDBM while maintaining resilience means recognizing that (i) biodiversity is important for long-term ecosystem persistence, (ii) natural disturbances play a critical role as a generator of structural and compositional heterogeneity at multiple scales, and (iii) traditional management tends to produce forests more homogeneous than those disturbed naturally and increases the likelihood of unexpected catastrophic change by constraining variation of key environmental processes. NDBM may maintain resilience if silvicultural strategies retain the structures and processes that perpetuate desired states while reducing those that enhance resilience of undesirable states. Such strategies require an understanding of harvesting impacts on slow ecosystem processes, such as seed-bank or nutrient dynamics, which in the long term can lead to ecological surprises by altering the forest's capacity to reorganize after disturbance.},

The Biodiversity Forecasting Tool (BFT) helps answer three important questions relating to regional biodiversity persistence: `how much' biodiversity can persist for a given land-management scenario; `what' habitats to focus conservation effort on; and `where' in the landscape to undertake conservation action. The tool integrates fine-scaled variability in vegetation composition and structure with spatial context, which is critical for ensuring the viability of populations. Thus, a raster data framework is employed which deems each location or gridcell in a landscape as contributing to biodiversity benefits to various degrees. At its simplest, just two spatial inputs, vegetation community types and vegetation condition, are needed. Drawing on, as a case-study, a broad-scale biodiversity assessment for NSW, Australia, this paper reports on the successful application of the BFT tool for a variety of functions ranging from interactive scenario evaluation through to conservation benefits mapping.},

We observed a large variability in seedling density across domains and presence of sites with abundant yellow birch regeneration within all three bioclimatic domains. Seedling density was positively correlated to mean age and abundance of yellow birch trees in the canopy, while sapling density was positively associated with dryer habitats. Growth patterns of canopy trees showed no effect of declining temperatures along the south\textendash{}north gradient. Environmental controls of birch distribution at its northern limit were realized through factors affecting birch regeneration and not growth of canopy trees. At the stand scale, regeneration density was strongly controlled by local site conditions and not by differences in climate among sites. At the regional scale, climate variability could be an indirect driver of yellow birch distribution, affecting disturbance rates and, subsequently, availability of suitable sites for regeneration.},

  abstract = {Questions Soil properties have been widely shown to influence plant growth and distribution. However, the degree to which edaphic variables can improve models based on topo-climatic variables is still unclear. In this study, we tested the roles of seven edaphic variables, namely (1) pH; (2) the content of nitrogen and of (3) phosphorus; (4) silt; (5) sand; (6) clay and (7) carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, as predictors of species distribution models in an edaphically heterogeneous landscape. We also tested how the respective influence of these variables in the models is linked to different ecological and functional species characteristics. Location The Western Alps, Switzerland. Methods With four different modelling techniques, we built models for 115 plant species using topo-climatic variables alone and then topo-climatic variables plus each of the seven edaphic variables, one at a time. We evaluated the contribution of each edaphic variable by assessing the change in predictive power of the model. In a second step, we evaluated the importance of the two edaphic variables that yielded the largest increase in predictive power in one final set of models for each species. Third, we explored the change in predictive power and the importance of variables across plant functional groups. Finally, we assessed the influence of the edaphic predictors on the prediction of community composition by stacking the models for all species and comparing the predicted communities with the observed community. Results Among the set of edaphic variables studied, pH and nitrogen content showed the highest contributions to improvement of the predictive power of the models, as well as the predictions of community composition. When considering all topo-climatic and edaphic variables together, pH was the second most important variable after degree-days. The changes in model results caused by edaphic predictors were dependent on species characteristics. The predictions for the species that have a low specific leaf area, and acidophilic preferences, tolerating low soil pH and high humus content, showed the largest improvement by the addition of pH and nitrogen in the model. Conclusions pH was an important predictor variable for explaining species distribution and community composition of the mountain plants considered in our study. pH allowed more precise predictions for acidophilic species. This variable should not be neglected in the construction of species distribution models in areas with contrasting edaphic conditions.},

Nevertheless, relatively little is known about the abiotic environmental factors (including climate) that control carbon storage in temperate and boreal forests and consequently, about their potential response to climate changes. From a set of more than 94,000 forest inventory plots and a large set of spatial data on forest attributes interpreted from aerial photographs, we constructed a fine-resolution map ({$\sim$}375 m) of the current carbon stock in aboveground live biomass in the 435,000 km2 of managed forests in Quebec, Canada. Our analysis resulted in an area-weighted average aboveground carbon stock for productive forestland of 37.6 Mg ha-1, which is lower than commonly reported values for similar environment. Models capable of predicting the influence of mean annual temperature, annual precipitation, and soil physical environment on maximum stand-level aboveground carbon stock (MSAC) were developed. These models were then used to project the future MSAC in response to climate change. Our results indicate that the MSAC was significantly related to both mean annual temperature and precipitation, or to the interaction of these variables, and suggest that Quebec's managed forests MSAC may increase by 20\% by 2041\textendash{}2070 in response to climate change. Along with changes in climate, the natural disturbance regime and forest management practices will nevertheless largely drive future carbon stock at the landscape scale. Overall, our results allow accurate accounting of carbon stock in aboveground live tree biomass of Quebec's forests, and provide a better understanding of possible feedbacks between climate change and carbon storage in temperate and boreal forests.},

The mixture of mid- and shade-tolerant species in the canopy, the inverse J-shape stem diameter distribution, and the age distribution were indicative that the two stands were in a late-successional stage. Recruitment of mid-tolerant species above 1.3~m in height appeared to be periodic and synchronized with historical spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana Clem.) outbreaks, while the coniferous component of these mixedwood stands recruited continuously. Results suggest that recruitment of yellow birch and red maple (Acer rubrum L.) requires disturbances of a certain intensity that affect at least 25~\% of the forest cover. In contrast, balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) and red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) can recruit under the canopy without relying on moderate or large canopy disturbances. Results suggest that the historical disturbance regime, and differences in shade tolerance between species, largely govern the contemporary composition of these stands. This study improves the comprehension of mechanisms that regulate the dynamics of yellow birch-conifer stands and will be useful for the subsequent elaboration of forest management strategies.},

Such changes may alter the sustainability of these uneven-aged ecosystems. The hypothesis that the decline observed in sugar maple populations over recent decades has modified stand structure and composition was tested using data from the Forest Ecosystem Research and Monitoring Network (RESEF) in Qu{\'e}bec, Canada. Analysis of the diameter class density distribution, growth rates, and mortality schedule for 12 stands indicated a decline in health and productivity in the sugar maple population. This result suggests that environmental factors have limited the development of this species in all strata. The American beech population responded by doubling its pole cohort density in 10 years. Although increases in American beech stem density tended to counter sugar maple mortality, results suggest that stand structure has been shifted from a sustainable structure to an unsustainable one over a 10-year period. The high mortality of sugar maple and the large increase of pole-size beech trees deeply altered forest structure and composition in the majority of stands studied. These changes question seriously the sustainability of sugar maple in these forest ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Over the last few decades, several phenomena contributed to modify the structure and composition of the eastern North American forests. Along with forest management, disturbances such as insect defoliation, global environmental changes, acid deposition, and rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations, have been identified as phenomena that could affect forest structure and composition. Currently, there is very little quantitative information on the resulting effect of multiple disturbances on the main parameters of forest dynamics (growth, mortality, and recruitment). Using available data from the Quebec permanent sample plots network, we analyzed the ecological response of tree species populations to the combined effect of contemporary global environmental changes, disturbance regimes, and forest management practices over the last 30 years in southern Quebec. The results indicate that the main parameters of forest dynamics changed considerably over the last three decades. The last spruce budworm outbreak initiated a successional change in coniferous stands. The basal area of Abies balsamea and Picea glauca, the most abundant coniferous species, decreased by 29.7\%, while pioneer species abundance increased. For late successional deciduous species, observed changes in forest dynamics appear to be mainly associated with global environmental changes rather than with natural disturbances or forest harvesting. The results indicate that inferring responses of tree population dynamics to global environmental changes can be very complex or even misleading considering the confounding effects of other disturbance agents. The results also suggest that the ecosystem-based management approach promoted by forest ecologists, aimed at maintaining landscape stand composition and structures similar to those characterizing natural environments, will not be easily achieved. Forest ecosystems are highly dynamic and disturbances other than tree harvesting appear to have been the major factors affecting their pattern of change over the last three decades. Forest managers should consider adaptive management approaches that will consider the contemporary evolution of forest ecosystems in a changing environment.},

  abstract = {Understanding how biodiversity affects functioning of ecosystems requires integrating diversity within trophic levels (horizontal diversity) and across trophic levels (vertical diversity, including food chain length and omnivory). We review theoretical and experimental progress toward this goal. Generally, experiments show that biomass and resource use increase similarly with horizontal diversity of either producers or consumers. Among prey, higher diversity often increases resistance to predation, due to increased probability of including inedible species and reduced efficiency of specialist predators confronted with diverse prey. Among predators, changing diversity can cascade to affect plant biomass, but the strength and sign of this effect depend on the degree of omnivory and prey behaviour. Horizontal and vertical diversity also interact: adding a trophic level can qualitatively change diversity effects at adjacent levels. Multitrophic interactions produce a richer variety of diversity-functioning relationships than the monotonic changes predicted for single trophic levels. This complexity depends on the degree of consumer dietary generalism, trade-offs between competitive ability and resistance to predation, intraguild predation and openness to migration. Although complementarity and selection effects occur in both animals and plants, few studies have conclusively documented the mechanisms mediating diversity effects. Understanding how biodiversity affects functioning of complex ecosystems will benefit from integrating theory and experiments with simulations and network-based approaches.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new and simple method to find indicator species and species assemblages characterizing groups of sites. The novelty of our approach lies in the way we combine a species relative abundance with its relative frequency of occurrence in the various groups of sites. This index is maximum when all individuals of a species are found in a single group of sites and when the species occurs in all sites of that group; it is a symmetric indicator. The statistical significance of the species indicator values is evaluated using a randomization procedure. Contrary to Twinspan, our indicator index for a given species is independent of the other species relative abundances, and there is no need to use pseudospecies. The new method identifies indicator species for typologies of species relev{\'e}s obtained by any hierarchical or nonhierarchical classification procedure; its use is independent of the classification method. Because indicator species give ecological meaning to groups of sites, this method provides criteria to compare typologies, to identify where to stop dividing clusters into subsets, and to point out the main levels in a hierarchical classification of sites. Species can be grouped on the basis of their indicator values for each clustering level, the heterogeneous nature of species assemblages observed in any one site being well preserved. Such assemblages are usually a mixture of eurytopic (higher level) and stenotopic species (characteristic of lower level clusters). The species assemblage approach demonstrates the importance of the ``sampled patch size,'' i.e., the diversity of sampled ecological combinations, when we compare the frequencies of core and satellite species. A new way to present species\textendash{}site tables, accounting for the hierarchical relationships among species, is proposed. A large data set of carabid beetle distributions in open habitats of Belgium is used as a case study to illustrate the new method.},

The storm, which occurred in January 1998, is the worst on record in eastern North America; glaze ice on the order of 80\textendash{}100 mm accumulated at our study site. All but 3\% of the trees (DBH {$\geq$} 10 cm) lost at least some crown branches, and 35\% lost more than half their crown. Damage to trees increased in the order: Tsuga canadensis, Betula alleghaniensis, Ostrya virginiana, Acer saccharum, Fagus grandifolia, Quercus rubra, Betula papyrifera, Acer rubrum, Tilia americana, and Fraxinus americana. Only 22\% of the saplings and small trees (4 cm {$<$} DBH {$<$} 10 cm) escaped being broken or pinned to the ground by falling material. Levels of damage generally were greater in an exposed ridge top forest than in a cove protected from wind. By August 1999 only 53\% of the trees had new shoots developing from the trunk or broken branches; among the more dominant canopy trees, Fagus grandifolia had the least sprouting and Acer saccharum and Quercus rubra the most. We anticipate and will monitor both significant turnover in the tree community and some shift in composition of the canopy dominants.},

We studied these effects by simulating primary species loss in 16 food webs from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and measuring robustness in terms of the secondary extinctions that followed. As observed in other networks, food webs are more robust to random removal of species than to selective removal of species with the most trophic links to other species. More surprisingly, robustness increases with food-web connectance but appears independent of species richness and omnivory. In particular, food webs experience `rivet-like' thresholds past which they display extreme sensitivity to removal of highly connected species. Higher connectance delays the onset of this threshold. Removing species with few trophic connections generally has little effect though there are several striking exceptions. These findings emphasize how the number of species removed affects ecosystems differently depending on the trophic functions of species removed.},

What role did human activities play in the changes in forest composition in this region? Location: Northern range limit of northern hardwoods in the Lower St. Lawrence region of eastern Qu{\'e}bec, Canada. Methods: We used early land survey records (1846\textendash{}1949) of public lands to reconstruct pre-settlement forest composition. The data consist of ranked tree species enumerations at points or for segments along surveyed lines, with enumerations of forest cover types and notes concerning disturbances. An original procedure was developed to weigh and combine these differing data types (line versus point observations; taxa versus cover enumerations). Change to present-day forest composition was evaluated by comparing survey records with forest decadal surveys conducted by the government of Qu{\'e}bec over the last 30 years (1980\textendash{}2009). Results: Pre-settlement dominance of conifers was strong and uniform across the study area, whereas dominance of maple and birches was patchy. Cedar and spruce were less likely to dominate with increasing altitude, whereas maple displayed the reverse trend. Frequency of disturbances, especially logging and fire, increased greatly after 1900. Comparison of survey records and modern plots showed general increases for maple (mentioned frequency increased by 39\%), poplar (36\%) and paper birch (31\%). Considering only taxa ranked first by surveyors, cedar displayed the largest decrease (19\%), whereas poplar (15\%) and maple (9\%) increased significantly. Conclusions: These changes in forest composition can be principally attributed to clear-cutting and colonization fire disturbances throughout the 20th century, and mostly reflected the propensity of taxa to expand (maples/aspen) or decline (cedar/spruce) with increased disturbance frequency. Qu{\'e}bec's land survey archives provide an additional data source to reconstruct and validate our knowledge of North America's pre-settlement temperate and sub-boreal forests.},

Managers are increasingly seeking adaptation strategies to manage these forests. We explored the efficacy of two alternative management scenarios compared with business-as-usual (BAU) management: expanding forest reserves meant to preserve forest identity and increase resistance, and modified silviculture meant to preserve forest function and increase adaptive capacity. Our study landscapes encompassed northeastern Minnesota and northern Lower Michigan, which are predicted to experience significant changes in a future climate and represent a gradient of latitude, forest type, and management. We used the LANDIS-II forest simulation model to simulate forest change under current climate, low emissions climate, and high emissions climate futures. Our results suggest that under a low emissions climate scenario, expanded reserves and modified silviculture strategies can be effective at increasing resistance by preserving forest composition, including legacy species (e.g., balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.)), and increasing adaptive capacity by maintaining or increasing aboveground biomass compared with BAU management. Under a high emissions climate scenario, the expanded reserve strategy was not effective at preserving legacy species; however, the modified silviculture strategy was effective at increasing aboveground biomass compared with BAU management. These results highlight alternative management options and limitations in the face of climate change.},

One of the most pronounced effects may be a decline in resistance to chronic change and resilience to acute disturbances. The capacity for forests to persist and/or adapt to climate change remains largely unknown, in part because there is not broad agreement how to measure and apply resilience concepts.ObjectivesWe assessed the interactions of climate change, resistance, resilience, diversity, and alternative management of northern Great Lake forests.MethodsWe simulated two landscapes (northern Minnesota and northern lower Michigan), three climate futures (current climate, a low emissions trajectory, and a high emissions trajectory), and four management regimes [business as usual, expanded forest reserves, modified silviculture, and climate suitable planting (CSP)]. We simulated each scenario with a forest landscape simulation model. We assessed resistance as the change in species composition over time. We assessed resilience and calculated an index of resilience that incorporated both recovery of pre-fire tree species composition and aboveground biomass within simulated burned areas.ResultsResults indicate a positive relationship between diversity and resistance within low diversity areas. Simulations of the high emission climate future resulted in a decline in both resistance and resilience.ConclusionsOf the management regimes, the CSP regime resulted in some of the greatest resilience under climate change although our results suggest that differences in forest management are largely outweighed by the effects of climate change. Our results provide a framework for assessing resistance and resilience relevant and valuable to a broad array of ecological systems.},

Here, we advance the spatially explicit neutral model by representing the metacommunity as a network of smaller communities. Analytic theory is presented for a set of equilibrium diversity patterns in networks of communities, facilitating the exploration of parameter space not accessible by simulation. We use this theory to evaluate how the basic properties of a metacommunity \textendash{} connectivity, size, and speciation rate \textendash{} determine overall metacommunity c-diversity, and how that is partitioned into a- and b-components. We find spatial structure can increase c-diversity relative to a well-mixed model, even when h is held constant. The magnitude of deviations from the well-mixed model and the partitioning into a- and b-diversity is related to the ratio of migration and speciation rates. c-diversity scales linearly with metacommunity size even as a- and b-diversity scale nonlinearly with size.},

Karst.) forest stands in southern Finland. Models were based on a 5-year monitoring period of permanent sample plots established in forest stands managed by selective harvests. Separate models were obtained for spruce, birch (Betula pendula Roth and Betula pubescens Ehrh.) and aspen (Populus tremula L.), all of which were well represented in the data. Since the stand structure of uneven-aged forests is irregular, spatial variation in competition factors and species composition were considered in the modelling. Due to the spatially hierarchical correlation structures of the data, a mixed modelling technique was applied in the estimation of the model parameters. Establishment models were developed for the number and initial height of established seedlings that had attained the set threshold height limit of 10 cm during a 5year period and thereafter survived until the end of the period. Prediction models were also developed for the survival, height increment and diameter at breast height of juvenile trees that were at least 10 cm tall at the beginning of the 5-year period. The latter model is needed only when juvenile tree models are replaced with models for advanced trees. Simulations conducted for demonstration and validation purposes revealed that the regeneration establishment and juvenile growth models can be applied to construct a simulation system for the optimisation of uneven-aged spruce stands in southern Finland.},

A disproportionate amount of past work has focused on distribution only, either documenting historical range shifts or predicting future occurrence patterns. However, simultaneous predictions of abundance and distribution across landscapes would be far more useful. To critically assess which approaches represent advances towards the goal of joint predictions of abundance and distribution, we review recent work on changing distributions and on effects of environmental drivers on single populations. Several methods have been used to predict changing distributions. Some of these can be easily modified to also predict abundance, but others cannot. In parallel, demographers have developed a much better understanding of how changing abiotic and biotic drivers will influence growth rate and abundance in single populations. However, this demographic work has rarely taken a landscape perspective and has largely ignored the effects of intraspecific density. We advocate a synthetic approach in which population models accounting for both density dependence and effects of environmental drivers are used to make integrated predictions of equilibrium abundance and distribution across entire landscapes. Such predictions would constitute an important step forward in assessing the ecological consequences of environmental changes.},

They are used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict distributions across landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation in space and time. SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both differences in species mobility and in ``established use.'' Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress. Remaining challenges include: improvement of methods for modeling presence-only data and for model selection and evaluation; accounting for biotic interactions; and assessing model uncertainty.},

This paper is written for ecologists and describes the MaxEnt model from a statistical perspective, making explicit links between the structure of the model, decisions required in producing a modelled distribution, and knowledge about the species and the data that might affect those decisions. To begin we discuss the characteristics of presence-only data, highlighting implications for modelling distributions. We particularly focus on the problems of sample bias and lack of information on species prevalence. The keystone of the paper is a new statistical explanation of MaxEnt which shows that the model minimizes the relative entropy between two probability densities (one estimated from the presence data and one, from the landscape) defined in covariate space. For many users, this viewpoint is likely to be a more accessible way to understand the model than previous ones that rely on machine learning concepts. We then step through a detailed explanation of MaxEnt describing key components (e.g. covariates and features, and definition of the landscape extent), the mechanics of model fitting (e.g. feature selection, constraints and regularization) and outputs. Using case studies for a Banksia species native to south-west Australia and a riverine fish, we fit models and interpret them, exploring why certain choices affect the result and what this means. The fish example illustrates use of the model with vector data for linear river segments rather than raster (gridded) data. Appropriate treatments for survey bias, unprojected data, locally restricted species, and predicting to environments outside the range of the training data are demonstrated, and new capabilities discussed. Online appendices include additional details of the model and the mathematical links between previous explanations and this one, example code and data, and further information on the case studies.},

  abstract = {Matrix projection models occupy a central role in population and conservation biology. Matrix models divide a population into discrete classes, even if the structuring trait exhibits continuous variation (e.g., body size). The integral projection model (IPM) avoids discrete classes and potential artifacts from arbitrary class divisions, facilitates parsimonious modeling based on smooth relationships between individual state and demographic performance, and can be implemented with standard matrix software. Here, we extend the IPM to species with complex demographic attributes, including dormant and active life stages, cross-classification by several attributes (e.g., size, age, and condition), and changes between discrete and continuous structure over the life cycle. We present a general model encompassing these cases, numerical methods, and theoretical results, including stable population growth and sensitivity/ elasticity analysis for density-independent models, local stability analysis in density-dependent models, and optimal/evolutionarily stable strategy life-history analysis. Our presentation centers on an IPM for the thistle Onopordum illyricum based on a 6-year field study. Flowering and death probabilities are size and age dependent, and individuals also vary in a latent attribute affecting survival, but a predictively accurate IPM is completely parameterized by fitting a few regression equations. The online edition of the American Naturalist includes a zip archive of R scripts illustrating our suggested methods.},

Synthesis and summary 604 Acknowledgements 605 References 605 Summary Biological stoichiometry theory considers the balance of multiple chemical elements in living systems, whereas metabolic scaling theory considers how size affects metabolic properties from cells to ecosystems. We review recent developments integrating biological stoichiometry and metabolic scaling theories in the context of plant ecology and global change. Although vascular plants exhibit wide variation in foliar carbon?:?nitrogen?:?phosphorus ratios, they exhibit a higher degree of ?stoichiometric homeostasis? than previously appreciated. Thus, terrestrial carbon?:?nitrogen?:?phosphorus stoichiometry will reflect the effects of adjustment to local growth conditions as well as species? replacements. Plant stoichiometry exhibits size scaling, as foliar nutrient concentration decreases with increasing plant size, especially for phosphorus. Thus, small plants have lower nitrogen?:?phosphorus ratios. Furthermore, foliar nutrient concentration is reflected in other tissues (root, reproductive, support), permitting the development of empirical models of production that scale from tissue to whole-plant levels. Plant stoichiometry exhibits large-scale macroecological patterns, including stronger latitudinal trends and environmental correlations for phosphorus concentration (relative to nitrogen) and a positive correlation between nutrient concentrations and geographic range size. Given this emerging knowledge of how plant nutrients respond to environmental variables and are connected to size, the effects of global change factors (such as carbon dioxide, temperature, nitrogen deposition) can be better understood.},

In this study, we evaluate the degree to which the gap model ZELIG-CFS realistically predicts the long term stand development of mixed forests in southeastern Quebec when disturbance history is considered. An early 1930 forest inventory and disturbance data were used to evaluate model simulation performance over the 1930\textendash{}2013 period. ZELIG-CFS well predicted the basal area of balsam fir in simulations with and without disturbances. When disturbances were simulated, the predictions for white spruce and white birch were more realistic than in the simulation without disturbances. At the same time, deciduous species that contributed the most to the compositional changes observed during the 20th century in mixed forests (red maple, sugar maple, and trembling aspen) were systematically underestimated by the model. Several improvement avenues are suggested: (1) A better integration of regeneration strategies of tree species, especially the integration of a probability of vegetative reproduction for sprouting species like red maple, sugar maple, trembling aspen and northern white cedar, (2) Coupling gap models with a stand risk model to better simulate natural and human disturbance probability as a source of exogenous mortality.},

  abstract = {Aim: More powerful tests of biodiversity theories need to move beyond species richness and explicitly focus on mechanisms generating diversity via trait composition. The rise of trait-based ecology has led to an increased focus on the distribution and dynamics of traits across broad geographic and climatic gradients and how these distributions influence ecosystem function. However, a general theory of trait-based ecology, that can apply across different scales (e.g. species that differ in size) and gradients (e.g. temperature), has yet to be formulated. While research focused on metabolic and allometric scaling theory provides the basis for such a theory, it does not explicitly account for differences in traits within and across taxa, such as variation in the optimal temperature for growth. Here we synthesize trait-based and metabolic scaling approaches into a framework that we term `Trait Driver Theory' or TDT. It shows that the shape and dynamics of trait and size distributions can be linked to fundamental drivers of community assembly and how the community will respond to future drivers. To assess predictions and assumptions of TDT, we review several theoretical studies and recent empirical studies spanning local and biogeographic gradients. Further, we analyze how the shift in trait distributions influences ecosystem processes across an elevational gradient and a 140-year-long ecological experiment. We show that TDT provides a baseline for (i) recasting the predictions of ecological theories based on species richness in terms of the shape of trait distributions and (ii) integrating how specific traits, including body size, and functional diversity then `scale up' to influence ecosystem functioning and the dynamics of species assemblages across climate gradients. Further, TDT offers a novel framework to integrate trait, metabolic/allometric, and species-richness-based approaches to better predict functional biogeography and how assemblages of species have and may respond to climate change.},

Methods In a grassland with highly heterogeneous soils and community composition, small seedlings of two native plants, Lasthenia californica and Calycadenia pauciflora, were transplanted into factorially watered and fertilized plots. Measurements were made to test how the effect of climatic variability (mimicked by the watering treatment) on the survival, growth and seed production of these species was modulated by above-ground competition and by edaphic variables.   Key Results Increased competition outweighed the direct positive impacts of enhanced rainfall on most fitness measures for both species, resulting in no net effect of enhanced rainfall. Both species benefitted from enhanced rainfall when the absence of competitors was accompanied by high soil water retention capacity. Fertilization did not amplify the watering effects; rather, plants benefitted from enhanced rainfall or competitor removal only in ambient nutrient conditions with high soil water retention capacity.   Conclusions The findings show that the direct effects of climatic variability on plant fitness may be reversed or neutralized by competition and, in addition, may be strongly modulated by soil variation. Specifically, coarse soil texture was identified as a factor that may limit plant responsiveness to altered water availability. These results highlight the importance of considering the abiotic as well as biotic context when making future climate change forecasts.},

  abstract = {Aim Understanding the factors that govern species' geographical ranges is of utmost importance for predicting potential range shifts triggered by environmental change. Species ranges are partially limited by their tolerances to extrinsic environmental conditions such as climate and habitat. However, they are also determined by the capacity of species to disperse, establish new populations and proliferate, which are in turn dependent on species intrinsic life-history traits. So far, the contribution of intrinsic factors driving species distributions has been inconclusive, largely because intrinsic and extrinsic factors have not been examined simultaneously in a satisfactory way. We investigate how geographical ranges of plants are determined by both extrinsic environmental factors and species intrinsic life-history traits. Location Europe. Methods We compiled a database on plant geographical ranges, environmental tolerances and life-history traits that constitutes the largest dataset analysed to date (1276 species). We used generalized linear modelling to test if range size and range filling (the proportion of climatically suitable area a species occupies) are affected by dispersal distance, habitat breadth and 10 life-history traits related to establishment and proliferation. Results The species characteristics that were most linked to range limitations of European plant species were dispersal potential, seed bank persistence and habitat breadth (which together explained {$\geq$} 30\% of deviance in range filling and range size). Specific leaf area, which has been linked to establishment ability, made a smaller contribution to native range limitations. Main conclusions Our results can be used to improve estimates of extinction vulnerability under climate change. Species with high dispersal capacity, that can maintain viable seed banks for several years and that can live in an intermediate number of habitats have the fewest non-climatic limitations on their ranges, and are most likely to shift their geographical ranges under climate change. We suggest that climate-change risk assessments should not focus exclusively on dispersal capacity.},

We address how population-level variation and biotic interactions may affect range shifts by transplanting seeds and seedlings of western North American conifers of different origin populations into different competitive neighborhoods within and beyond their elevational ranges and monitoring their performance. We find evidence that competition with neighboring trees limits performance within current ranges, but that interactions between adults and juveniles switch from competitive to facilitative at upper range limits. Local adaptation had weaker effects on performance that did not predictably vary with range position or seed origin. Our findings suggest that competitive interactions may slow species turnover within forests at lower range limits, whereas facilitative interactions may accelerate the pace of tree expansions upward near timberline.},

With the ultimate goal of improving models of forest dynamics, here we construct a statistical model that combines complementary data sources, tree-ring and forest inventory data. A Bayesian hierarchical model was used to gain inference on the effects of many factors on tree growth\textemdash{}individual tree size, climate, biophysical conditions, stand-level competitive environment, tree-level canopy status, and forest management treatments\textemdash{}using both diameter at breast height (dbh) and tree-ring data. The model consists of two multiple regression models, one each for the two data sources, linked via a constant of proportionality between coefficients that are found in parallel in the two regressions. This model was applied to a data set of 130 increment cores and 500 repeat measurements of dbh at a single site in the Jemez Mountains of north-central New Mexico, USA. The tree-ring data serve as the only source of information on how annual growth responds to climate variation, whereas both data types inform non-climatic effects on growth. Inferences from the model included positive effects on growth of seasonal precipitation, wetness index, and height ratio, and negative effects of dbh, seasonal temperature, southerly aspect and radiation, and plot basal area. Climatic effects inferred by the model were confirmed by a dendroclimatic analysis. Combining the two data sources substantially reduced uncertainty about non-climate fixed effects on radial increments. This demonstrates that forest inventory data measured on many trees, combined with tree-ring data developed for a small number of trees, can be used to quantify and parse multiple influences on absolute tree growth. We highlight the kinds of research questions that can be addressed by combining the high-resolution information on climate effects contained in tree rings with the rich tree- and stand-level information found in forest inventories, including projection of tree growth under future climate scenarios, carbon accounting, and investigation of management actions aimed at increasing forest resilience.},

  abstract = {There have been considerable advances in our understanding of the tolerance of species interaction networks to sequential extinctions of plants and animals. However, communities of species exist in a mosaic of habitats, and the vulnerability of habitats to anthropogenic change varies. Here, we model the cascading effects of habitat loss, driven by plant extinctions, on the robustness of multiple animal groups. Our network is constructed from empirical observations of 11 animal groups in 12 habitats on farmland. We simulated sequential habitat removal scenarios: randomly; according to prior information; and with a genetic algorithm to identify best- and worst-case permutations of habitat loss. We identified two semi-natural habitats (waste ground and hedgerows together comprising {$<$} 5\% of the total area of the farm) as disproportionately important to the integrity of the overall network. Our approach provides a new tool for network ecologists and for directing the management and restoration of multiple-habitat sites.},

  abstract = {Plant species differ in many functional traits that drive differences in rates of photosynthesis, biomass allocation, and tissue turnover. Yet, it remains unclear how -- and even if -- such traits influence whole-plant growth, with the simple linear relationships predicted by existing theory often lacking empirical support. Here we present a new theoretical framework for understanding the effect of diverse functional traits on plant growth and shade-tolerance, extending a widely-used theoretical model that links growth rate in seedlings with a single leaf trait to explicitly include influences of size, light environment, and five other prominent traits: seed mass, height at maturation, leaf mass per unit leaf area, leaf nitrogen per unit leaf area, and wood density. Based on biomass production and allocation, this framework explains why the influence of prominent traits on growth rate and shade tolerance often varies with plant size and why the impact of size on growth varies among traits. Considering growth rate in height, we find the influence of: i) leaf mass per unit leaf area is strong in small plants but weakens with size, ii) leaf nitrogen per unit leaf area does not change with size, iii) wood density is present across sizes but is strongest at intermediate sizes, iv) height at maturation strengthens with size, and v) seed mass decreases with size. Moreover, we show how traits moderate plant responses to light environment and also determine shade tolerance, supporting diverse empirical results. By disentangling the effects of plant size, light environment and traits on growth rates, our results provide a solid theoretical foundation for trait ecology and thus provide a platform for understanding growth across diverse species around the world.},

  abstract = {Species are predicted to shift their distributions upslope or poleward in response to global warming. This prediction is supported by a growing number of studies documenting species migrations in temperate systems but remains poorly tested for tropical species, and especially for tropical plant species. We analyzed changes in tree species composition in a network of 10 annually censused 1-ha plots spanning an altitudinal gradient of 70\textendash{}2800 m elevation in Costa Rica. Specifically, we combined plot data with herbarium records (accessed through GBIF) to test if the plots' community temperature scores (CTS, average thermal mean of constituent species weighted by basal area) have increased over the past decade as is predicted by climate-driven species migrations. In addition, we quantified the contributions of stem growth, recruitment, and mortality to the observed patterns. Supporting our a priori hypothesis of upward species migrations, we found that there have been consistent directional shifts in the composition of the plots, such that the relative abundance of lowland species, and hence CTS, increased in 90\% of plots. The rate of the observed compositional shifts corresponds to a mean thermal migration rate (TMR) of 0.0065 \textdegree{}C yr-1 (95\% CI = 0.0005\textendash{}0.0132 \textdegree{}C yr-1). While the overall TMR is slower than predicted based on concurrent regional warming of 0.0167 \textdegree{}C yr-1, migrations were on pace with warming in 4 of the 10 plots. The observed shifts in composition were driven primarily by mortality events (i.e., the disproportionate death of highland vs. lowland species), suggesting that individuals of many tropical tree species will not be able to tolerate future warming and thus their persistence in the face of climate change will depend on successful migrations. Unfortunately, in Costa Rica and elsewhere, land area inevitably decreases at higher elevations; hence, even species that are able to migrate successfully will face heightened risks of extinction.},

Various studies have investigated the impacts of climate change, but large-scale, trait-specific impacts are less understood. We analyze abundance data over time for 86 tree species/groups across the eastern United States spanning the last three decades. We show that more tree species have experienced a westward shift (73\%) than a poleward shift (62\%) in their abundance, a trend that is stronger for saplings than adult trees. The observed shifts are primarily due to the changes of subpopulation abundances in the leading edges and are significantly associated with changes in moisture availability and successional processes. These spatial shifts are associated with species that have similar traits (drought tolerance, wood density, and seed weight) and evolutionary histories (most angiosperms shifted westward and most gymnosperms shifted poleward). Our results indicate that changes in moisture availability have stronger near-term impacts on vegetation dynamics than changes in temperature. The divergent responses to climate change by trait- and phylogenetic-specific groups could lead to changes in composition of forest ecosystems, putting the resilience and sustainability of various forest ecosystems in question.
Traits determine species responses to climate change, as most eastern U.S. trees shift westward following moisture change.

  abstract = {Red maple (Acer rubrum L.) is becoming increasingly dominant in forest stands throughout the eastern United States. To investigate the reasons for the increase, we examined the development of red maple and oak (Quercus spp.) seedlings and stump sprouts following the harvest of oak-dominated stands. Within 7 years after harvest, red maple seedlings were present in far greater numbers and captured more growing space than all oaks combined. Growing space occupied by red maple stump sprouts exceeded oak sprouts by a ratio of 3.5:1. Through stump sprouts alone, red maple fully recaptured the amount of growing space it had previously occupied in the overstory 7 years after harvest. Results from similar but older stands show that red maple dominance is sustained into the third decade of stand development. Red maple surpassed all oaks combined in rapid site capture through both seed-origin and sprout-origin regeneration. Red maple's superior ability to regenerate by sprouts is particularly favored by timber harvesting following a history of management and disturbance regimes that permit the accumulation of suppressed small-diameter red maple stems. Among the events and processes that promote stand conversion, timber harvesting may be the major proximal cause of the widespread, increasing dominance of red maple. Re\textasciiacute{}sume\textasciiacute{} : L'e\textasciiacute{}rable rouge (Acer rubrum L.) devient de plus en plus dominant dans les peuplements forestiers de l'est des E\textasciiacute{} tats-Unis.

Au cours des sept premie`res anne\textasciiacute{}es apre`s la coupe, les semis d'e\textasciiacute{}rable rouge e\textasciiacute{}taient beaucoup plus nombreux et occupaient plus d'espace de croissance que tous les che\textasciicircum{}nes regroupe\textasciiacute{}s.

Insect foraging has been shown to depend on both the quality of hosts and the distances between hosts. Given the spatial distribution of host plants and individual variation in quality, vector foraging patterns may therefore produce predictable variation in exposure to pathogens. We develop a ``gravity'' model to describe the spatial spread of a vector-borne plant pathogen from underlying models of insect foraging in response to host quality using the pollinator-borne smut fungus Microbotryum violaceum as a case study. We fit the model to spatially explicit time series of M. violaceum transmission in replicate experimental plots of the white campion Silene latifolia. The gravity model provides a better fit than a mean field model or a model with only distance-dependent transmission. The results highlight the importance of active vector foraging in generating spatial patterns of disease incidence and for pathogenmediated selection for floral traits.},

Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5\textendash{}15\% (0.07\textendash{}0.17 \textdegree{}C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were {$\geq$} 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.},

The lens of complex systems science yields insights into facets of forest structure and dynamics that facilitate comparisons among ecosystems. These biomes share the main properties of complex systems but differ in specific ecological properties, disturbance regimes, and human uses.

  abstract = {How tropical tree species respond to disturbance is a central issue of forest ecology, conservation and resource management. We define a hierarchical model to investigate how functional traits measured in control plots relate to the population change rate and to demographic rates for recruitment and mortality after disturbance by logging operations. Population change and demographic rates were quantified on a 12-year period after disturbance and related to seven functional traits measured in control plots. The model was calibrated using a Bayesian Network approach on 53 species surveyed in permanent forest plots (37.5 ha) at Paracou in French Guiana. The network analysis allowed us to highlight both direct and indirect relationships among predictive variables. Overall, 89\% of interspecific variability in the population change rate after disturbance were explained by the two demographic rates, the recruitment rate being the most explicative variable. Three direct drivers explained 45\% of the variability in recruitment rates, including leaf phosphorus concentration, with a positive effect, and seed size and wood density with negative effects. Mortality rates were explained by interspecific variability in maximum diameter only (25\%). Wood density, leaf nitrogen concentration, maximum diameter and seed size were not explained by variables in the analysis and thus appear as independent drivers of post-disturbance demography. Relationships between functional traits and demographic parameters were consistent with results found in undisturbed forests. Functional traits measured in control conditions can thus help predict the fate of tropical tree species after disturbance. Indirect relationships also suggest how different processes interact to mediate species demographic response.},

  abstract = {Interactions among species drive the ecological and evolutionary processes in ecological communities. These interactions are effectively key components of biodiversity. Studies that use a network approach to study the structure and dynamics of communities of interacting species have revealed many patterns and associated processes. Historically these studies were restricted to trophic interactions, although network approaches are now used to study a wide range of interactions, including for example the reproductive mutualisms. However, each interaction type remains studied largely in isolation from others. Merging the various interaction types within a single integrative framework is necessary if we want to further our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of communities. Dividing the networks up is a methodological convenience as in the field the networks occur together in space and time and will be linked by shared species. Herein, we outline a conceptual framework for studying networks composed of more than one type of interaction, highlighting key questions and research areas that would benefit from their study.},

  abstract = {In recruitment modeling, the response variable is a count and its distribution is often characterized by an excess number of zeros. As a result, standard distributions of probabilities, such as Poisson, are inappropriate. A common approach in forestry consists of using two-part conditional models. These models have two distinct components aimed to predicting the occurrence and abundance of recruitment, respectively. For such data, zero-inflated models might provide a more adequate framework by combining the two components into a joint distribution of probabilities. In this article, a conditional model is compared with two different zero-inflated models, namely, a zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) and a zero-inflated discrete Weibull (ZIdiW) model. The three models were calibrated using a data set provided by permanent sample plots located in hardwood stands. Parsimony criteria (the Akaike information criterion and the Bayesian information criterion) and diagnostic plots were used to perform the comparison. The results show that the ZIdiW model has the best fit. The flexibility of the Weibull function and the possibility of obtaining a more parsimonious model are two advantages related to the use of a ZIdiW model in recruitment modeling. FOR.

The model is based on a complementary log-log (CLL) link function, and was calibrated using permanent-plot data. Tree vigor, stem product, diameter at breast height and stand basal area were tested as explanatory variables. A plot and an interval random effect were specified to account for spatial correlations. When compared with the traditional logit link function, the CLL facilitates the inclusion of the time factor. In this case study, there was an important variability of mortality predictions between the plots and the intervals for a given plot. The interval random effect is thought to be associated with catastrophic mortality. Since both tree vigor and stem product proved to be significant mortality predictors, we recommend that these variables be evaluated to increase the accuracy of mortality models.},

In the first version, we use the exact network of interactions of two real mutualistic communities. In the other versions, we randomize the observed network of interactions using two different null models. We show that the community response to habitat loss is affected by network structure. Real communities start to decay sooner than random communities, but persist for higher destruction levels. There is a destruction threshold at which the community collapses. Our model is the first attempt to describe the dynamics of whole mutualistic metacommunities interacting in realistic ways.},

These two disturbance types exert different effects on forest dynamics, which can have major implications in terms of economic and ecological sustainability. This study compared the long-term effects of these two disturbance types on stand composition, stand density, and merchantable volume on eastern Canadian mesic boreal forests dominated by black spruce and balsam fir. We used 157 permanent sample plots (PSP), 41 of which originated from fire and 116 were from clear-cuts. Model selection with finite-sample corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) was used to understand which factors had the greatest influence on relative stand density and merchantable volume. Our results indicate that merchantable volume was positively influenced by stand density, which in turn was primarily influenced by disturbance origin, with post-cutting stands being denser than post-fire stands. These results indicated that an increase in stand density is an important mechanism through which disturbance acts upon merchantable volume. We also found differences in forest composition between stand-origin categories, with balsam fir being more abundant post-clearcutting; this was likely because advance regeneration was mainly composed of balsam fir, whereas post-fire stands are dominated by black spruce. Differences in merchantable volume between post-fire and post-clearcut stands become non-significant with time, likely because of higher tree growth and lower mortality in the dominant canopy of clearcut-origin stands. Overall, the results indicate that stand origin is an important determinant of stand composition and stand yield, but that the latter effect tends to disappear after a few decades. The higher balsam fir content generally observed in naturally regenerated, clear-cut origin stands could have potentially negative economic and ecological impacts at the landscape scale, which may call for mitigation strategies.},

The climate of the future will likely lead to higher mortality among mature trees, because of the greater frequency of droughts, fires, forest-leveling windstorms, and outbreaks of native and exotic insect pests and diseases. In addition, increasing populations of native deer and European earthworm invasions will inhibit the establishment of tree seedlings. The expected net impact of these factors will be a ``savannification'' of the forest, owing to the loss of adult trees at a rate faster than that at which they can be replaced.

  abstract = {In many multivariate domains, we are interested in analyzing the dependency structure of the underlying distribution, e.g., whether two variables are in direct interaction. We can represent dependency structures using Bayesian network models. To analyze a given data set, Bayesian model selection attempts to find the most likely (MAP) model, and uses its structure to answer these questions. However, when the amount of available data is modest, there might be many models that have non-negligible posterior. Thus, we want compute the Bayesian posterior of a feature, i.e., the total posterior probability of all models that contain it. In this paper, we propose a new approach for this task. We first show how to efficiently compute a sum over the exponential number of networks that are consistent with a fixed order over network variables. This allows us to compute, for a given order, both the marginal probability of the data and the posterior of a feature. We then use this result as the basis for an algorithm that approximates the Bayesian posterior of a feature. Our approach uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, but over orders rather than over network structures. The space of orders is smaller and more regular than the space of structures, and has much a smoother posterior ``landscape''. We present empirical results on synthetic and real-life datasets that compare our approach to full model averaging (when possible), to MCMC over network structures, and to a non-Bayesian bootstrap approach.},

Such models are widely used to infer community dynamics of sessile organisms because transition probabilities (the elements of transition probability matrices) can be estimated with time series data from ``grid sampling,'' where species occupancy states are assessed at multiple fixed points in a quadrat or transect. These estimates, however, are known to be biased when resampling error exists. In this study, we used the perspective of multistate dynamic occupancy models to develop a new Markov model that is structured hierarchically such that transitions among occupancy states and observation processes are considered explicitly at each fixed point. We show that, by adopting a hierarchical Bayesian approach, our model provides estimates for transition probabilities that are robust to sampling error. We also show that error rate may be estimated without additional data obtained from rapid repeated sampling. Considerations for the analysis for the application to real data set and potential extensions of the proposed model are discussed.},

B.S.P.) is the dominant tree species in the Canadian province of Qu{\'e}bec's boreal ecosystem, particularly in the black spruce-feathermoss (BSFM) domain (between the 49th and the 52nd parallels). While black spruce is generally well adapted to regenerate after wildfires, regeneration failure can sometimes occur, resulting in the irreversible conversion of closed-crown BSFM to open black spruce-lichen woodlands (OW). With OWs representing approximately 7\% (1.6Mha) of Qu{\'e}bec's BSFM domain, the afforestation of OWs carries significant theoretical potential for carbon (C) sequestration, which has not yet been evaluated. The main objectives of the study were then: (i) to estimate the theoretical C balance of OW afforestation within the closed-crown BSFM domain in Qu{\'e}bec's boreal forest; (ii) to calculate, using the life cycle analysis (LCA) method, all the GHG emissions related to black spruce OW afforestation in the closed-crown BSFM domain of Qu{\'e}bec. The CO2FIX v. 3.1 model was used to calculate the biological C balance between the baseline (natural OW of site index 9 at age 50) and afforestation (black spruce plantation of site index 6 at age 25) scenarios, using the best estimates available for all five recommended C compartments (aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, litter, deadwood, and soil). The simulation revealed a biological C balance of 77.0tCha-1, 70 years following afforestation, for an average net sequestration rate of 1.1tCha-1year-1. Biological C balance only turns positive after 27 years. When integrating the uncertainties related to both the plantation growth yield and the wildfire disturbance, the average sequestration rate varies between 0.2 and 1.9tCha-1year-1. GHG emissions are 1.3tCO2equiv.ha-1 for all afforestation-related operations, which is less than 0.5\% of the biological C balance after 70 years. Thus, GHG emissions do not significantly affect the net C balance of the afforestation project simulated. Several recommendations are made, mostly centered on the factors influencing the growth rate of carbon stocks and the impact of natural disturbances, to minimize the range of uncertainties associated to the sequestration potential and maximize the mitigation benefits of an OW afforestation project.},

  abstract = {Ecosystems are exposed to multiple stressors which can compromise functioning and service delivery. These stressors often co-occur and interact in different ways which are not yet fully understood. Here, we applied a population model representing a freshwater amphipod feeding on leaf litter in forested streams. We simulated impacts of hypothetical stressors, individually and in pairwise combinations that target the individuals' feeding, maintenance, growth and reproduction. Impacts were quantified by examining responses at three levels of biological organisation: individual-level body sizes and cumulative reproduction, population-level abundance and biomass and ecosystem-level leaf litter decomposition. Interactive effects of multiple stressors at the individual level were mostly antagonistic, that is, less negative than expected. Most population- and ecosystem-level responses to multiple stressors were stronger than expected from an additive model, that is, synergistic. Our results suggest that across levels of biological organisation responses to multiple stressors are rarely only additive. We suggest methods for efficiently quantifying impacts of multiple stressors at different levels of biological organisation.},

Most biodiversity\textendash{}ecosystem function studies, however, consider only one response variable at a time, and even when multiple variables are examined they are analyzed separately. This means that a very important aspect of biodiversity is overlooked: the possibility for different species to carry out different functions at any one time. We propose a conceptual model to explore the effects of species loss on overall ecosystem functioning, where overall functioning is defined as the joint effect of many ecosystem functions. We show that, due to multifunctional complementarity among species, overall functioning is more susceptible to species loss than are single functions. Modeled relationships between species richness and overall ecosystem functioning using five empirical data sets on monocultures reflected the range of effects of species loss on multiple functions predicted by the model. Furthermore, an exploration of the correlations across functions and the degree of redundancy within functions revealed that multifunctional redundancy was generally lower than single-function redundancy in these empirical data sets. We suggest that by shifting the focus to the variety of functions maintained by a diversity of species, the full importance of biodiversity for the functioning of ecosystems can be uncovered. Our results are thus important for conservation and management of biota and ecosystem services.},

The expected increase in mortality under climate change, on the other hand, prompted a higher degree of regeneration via the release of niche space, although not enough to maintain current abundance levels. Colonization spatial patterns did not vary significantly with climatic conditions, but the species was able to increase its distribution under climate change more than in a constant climate scenario. Our approach yields relevant information at different spatial scales, from plot-level processes to large-scale abundance patterns. With it, we clearly indicate the strong role that climate change could have in shaping future forest communities through its differential influence on demographic processes.},

We therefore carried out an evaluation of the timber supply vulnerability to current and future fire risk through simplified calculations involving historical forest growth and harvest rates and current and projected forest burn rates. Calculations were performed at the level of forest management areas (FMAs) across the boreal and montane ecozones of Canada. For some FMAs, the vulnerability of timber supply to fire was estimated to be high to extreme by the middle of the century. For those FMAs, the increases in tree growth necessary to negate these risks were generally unrealistic. A modest simulated decrease in tree growth over time, however, was sufficient to raise the vulnerability of many other FMAs from low to moderate. Known biases in the analysis suggest that our assessment might underestimate the level of vulnerability in all FMAs. Other natural disturbances are not included in the analysis but their impact on timber supply may be additive to that of fire. Some adaptation measures to face these increasing risks are discussed.},

We proposed one of the first comprehensive frameworks tracking local changes in community composition related to climate changes. First, we investigated whether and how 12 years of changes in the local composition of bird communities were related to local climate variations. Then, we tested the consequences of this climate-induced adjustment of communities on Grinnellian (habitat-related) and Eltonian (function-related) homogenization. A standardized protocol monitoring spatial and temporal trends of birds over France from 2001 to 2012 was used. For each plot and each year, we used the spring temperature and the spring precipitations and calculated three indices reflecting the thermal niche, the habitat specialization, and the functional originality of the species within a community. We then used a moving-window approach to estimate the spatial distribution of the temporal trends in each of these indices and their congruency with local climatic variations. Temperature fluctuations and community dynamics were found to be highly variable in space, but their variations were finely congruent. More interestingly, the community adjustment to temperature variations was nonmonotonous. Instead, unexplained fluctuations in community composition were observed up to a certain threshold of climate change intensity, above which a change in community composition was observed. This shift corresponded to a significant decrease in the relative abundance of habitat specialists and functionally original species within communities, regardless of the direction of temperature change. The investigation of variations in climate and community responses appears to be a central step toward a better understanding of climate change effects on biodiversity. Our results suggest a fine-scale and short-term adjustment of community composition to temperature changes. Moreover, significant temperature variations seem to be responsible for both the Grinnellian and Eltonian aspects of functional homogenization.},

  abstract = {The spatial tracking of climatic shifts is frequently reported as a biodiversity response to climatic change. However, species' range shifts are often idiosyncratic and inconsistent with climatic shift predictions. At the community scale, this discrepancy can be measured by comparing the spatial shift in the relative composition of cold- vs. warmadapted species in a local assemblage [the community temperature index (CTI)] with the spatial shift in temperature isotherms. While the local distribution of climate change velocity is a promising approach to downscaling climate change pressure and responses, CTI velocity has only been investigated on a continental or national scale. In this study, we coupled French Breeding Bird Survey data, collected from 2133 sites monitored between 2001 and 2012, with climatic data in order to estimate the local magnitude and direction of breeding season temperature shift, CTI shift, and their spatiotemporal divergence \textendash{} the local climatic debt. We also tested whether landscape characteristics that are known to affect climate velocity and spatial tracking of climate change mediated the climatic debt on the local scale. We found a clear spatial structure, together with heterogeneity in both temperature and CTI spatial shifts. Local climatic debt decreased as the elevation, habitat diversity, and the naturalness of the landscape increased. These results suggest the complementary effects of the local topographic patterns sheltering more diverse microclimates and the increasing permeability of natural and diversified landscape. Our findings suggest that a more nuanced evaluation of spatial variability in climatic and biotic shifts is necessary in order to properly describe biodiversity responses to climate change rather than the oversimplified descriptions of uniform poleward shifts.},

Metapopulation abundance is largely affected by the architecture of the spatial network, although this effect depends on demographic parameters here represented by the extinction-to-colonization ratio (e/c). Thus, for moderate to large e/c-values, regional abundance grows with the heterogeneity of the network, with uniform or random networks having the lowest regional abundances, and scale-free networks having the largest abundance. However, the ranking is reversed for low extinction probabilities, with heterogeneous networks showing the lowest relative abundance. We further explore the mechanisms underlying such results by relating a node's incidence (average number of time steps the node is occupied) with its degree, and with the average degree of the nodes it interacts with. These results demonstrate the importance of spatial network structure to understanding metapopulation abundance, and serve to determine under what circumstances information on network structure should be complemented with information on the species life-history traits to understand persistence in heterogeneous environments. \& 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {There is good evidence that species' distributions are shifting poleward in response to climate change and wide interest in the magnitude of such responses for scientific and conservation purposes. It has been suggested from the directions of climatic changes that species' distribution shifts may not be simply poleward, but this has been rarely tested with observed data. Here, we apply a novel approach to measuring range shifts on axes ranging through 360\textdegree, to recent data on the distributions of 122 species of British breeding birds during 1988\textendash{}1991 and 2008\textendash{}2011. Although previously documented poleward range shifts have continued, with an average 13.5 km shift northward, our analysis indicates this is an underestimate because it ignores common and larger shifts that occurred along axes oriented to the north-west and north-east. Trailing edges contracted from a broad range of southerly directions. Importantly, these results are derived from systematically collected data so confounding observer-effort biases can be discounted. Analyses of climate for the same period show that whilst temperature trends should drive species along a north\textendash{}north-westerly trajectory, directional responses to precipitation will depend on both the time of year that is important for determining a species' distribution, and the location of the range margin. Directions of species' range centroid shift were not correlated with spatial trends in any single climate variable. We conclude that range shifts of British birds are multidirectional, individualistic and probably determined by species-specific interactions of multiple climate factors. Climate change is predicted to lead to changes in community composition through variation in the rates that species' ranges shift; our results suggest communities could change further owing to constituent species shifting along different trajectories. We recommend more studies consider directionality in climate and range dynamics to produce more appropriate measures of observed and expected responses to climate change.},

  abstract = {In this era of climate change, understanding past and predicting future fire activity are scientific challenges that are central to the development of sustainable forest management practices and policies. Such objectives, however, are difficult to achieve for several reasons. Uncertainties about future fire activity can be superimposed on the short time period covered by existing meteorological data and fire statistics, from which a historical range of variability can be determined. Regional fire activity is also tremendously variable over time, such that contemporary fire records cannot provide information on the full range of fire activity variability a given forest experienced and adapted to. This factor is increasingly important when it comes to determining the resilience of boreal forests to changes in climate and disturbance regimes. In this paper, we present a synthesis of past, present and future trends in seasonal fire danger and fire activity based on data gathered in eastern Canadian boreal forests over the last 20 years, and we provide a critical assessment of the ability to conduct sustainable forest management over the 21st century. The data synthesis provides compelling evidence of a synchronous pattern of decreasing fireconducive climatic conditions and activity of large fire seasons over the last 2000 years in the eastern coniferous boreal forest. Model simulations suggest that the climate will become drier in upcoming decades, driving future fire activity close to the upper bound of the pre-industrial range of variability. The effects of increasing fire incidence cumulated with forest harvesting may thus pose a risk to forest resilience in the future. This ecological knowledge should help us to define forest management strategies and practices considering future fire activity changes forecasted under climate change. Development of alternative silvicultural interventions that would emulate secondary disturbances (e.g. wind, insects) rather than fire would be necessary to maintain pre-industrial forest characteristics (e.g. composition and age class distribution), and associated forest resilience.},

  abstract = {An increasing number of studies conclude that water limitations and heat stress may hinder the capacity of black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) trees, a dominant species of Canada's boreal forests, to grow and assimilate atmospheric carbon. However, there is currently no scientific consensus on the future of these forests over the next century in the context of widespread climate warming. The large spatial extent of black spruce forests across the Canadian boreal forest and associated variability in climate, demography, and site conditions pose challenges for projecting future climate change responses. Here we provide an evaluation of the impacts of climate warming and drying, as well as increasing [CO2], on the aboveground productivity of black spruce forests across Canada south of 60\textdegree{}N for the period 1971 to 2100. We use a new extensive network of tree-ring data obtained from Canada's National Forest Inventory, spatially explicit simulations of net primary productivity (NPP) and its drivers, and multivariate statistical modeling. We found that soil water availability is a significant driver of black spruce interannual variability in productivity across broad areas of the western to eastern Canadian boreal forest. Interannual variability in productivity was also found to be driven by autotrophic respiration in the warmest regions. In most regions, the impacts of soil water availability and respiration on interannual variability in productivity occurred during the phase of carbohydrate accumulation the year preceding tree-ring formation. Results from projections suggest an increase in the importance of soil water availability and respiration as limiting factors on NPP over the next century due to warming, but this response may vary to the extent that other factors such as carbon dioxide fertilization, and respiration acclimation to high temperature, contribute to dampening these limitations.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in remote sensing and ecological modeling warrant a timely and robust investigation of the ecological variables that underlie large-scale patterns of breeding bird species richness, particularly in the context of intensifying land use and climate change. Our objective was to address this need using an array of bioclimatic and remotely sensed data sets representing vegetation properties and structure, and other aspects of the physical environment. We first build models of bird species richness across breeding bird survey (BBS) routes, and then spatially predict richness across the coterminous US at moderately high spatial resolution (1 km). Predictor variables were derived from various sources and maps of species richness were generated for four groups (guilds) of birds with different breeding habitat affiliation (forest, grassland, open woodland, scrub/shrub), as well as all guilds combined. Predictions of forest bird distributions were strong (R2 = 0.85), followed by grassland (0.76), scrub/shrub (0.63) and open woodland (0.60) species. Vegetation properties were generally the strongest determinants of species richness, whereas bioclimatic and lidar-derived vertical structure metrics were of variable importance and dependent upon the guild type. Environmental variables (climate and the physical environment) were also frequently selected predictors, but canopy structure variables were not as important as expected based on more local to regional scale studies. Relatively sparse sampling of canopy structure metrics from the satellite lidar sensor may have reduced their importance relative to other predictor variables across the study domain. We discuss these results in the context of the ecological drivers of species richness patterns, the spatial scale of bird diversity analyses, and the potential of next generation space-borne lidar systems relevant to vegetation and ecosystem studies. This study strengthens current understanding of bird species\textendash{}climate\textendash{}vegetation relationships, which could be further advanced with improved canopy structure information across spatial scales.},

  abstract = {Most large-scale multispecies studies of tree growth have been conducted in tropical and cool temperate forests, whereas Mediterranean water-limited ecosystems have received much less attention. This limits our understanding of how growth of coexisting tree species varies along environmental gradients in these forests, and the implications for species interactions and community assembly under current and future climatic conditions. Here, we quantify the absolute effect and relative importance of climate, tree size and competition as determinants of tree growth patterns in Iberian forests, and explore interspecific differences in the two components of competitive ability (competitive response and effect) along climatic and size gradients. Spatially explicit neighborhood models were developed to predict tree growth for the 15 most abundant Iberian tree species using permanent-plot data from the Spanish Second and Third National Forest Inventory (IFN). Our neighborhood analyses showed a climatic and size effect on tree growth, but also revealed that competition from neighbors has a comparatively much larger impact on growth in Iberian forests. Moreover, the sensitivity to competition (i.e. competitive response) of target trees varied markedly along climatic gradients causing significant rank reversals in species performance, particularly under xeric conditions. We also found compelling evidence for strong species-specific competitive effects in these forests. Altogether, these results constitute critical new information which not only furthers our understanding of important theoretical questions about the assembly of Mediterranean forests, but will also be of help in developing new guidelines for adapting forests in this climatic boundary to global change. If we consider the climatic gradients of this study as a surrogate for future climatic conditions, then we should expect absolute growth rates to decrease and sensitivity to competition to increase in most forests of the Iberian Peninsula (in all but the northern Atlantic forests), making these management considerations even more important in the future.},

  abstract = {Global species extinction rates are orders of magnitude above the background rate documented in the fossil record. However, recent data syntheses have found mixed evidence for patterns of net species loss at local spatial scales. For example, two recent data meta-a\-nalyses have found that species richness is decreasing in some locations and is increasing in others. When these trends are combined, these papers argued there has been no net change in species richness, and suggested this pattern is globally representative of biodiversity change at local scales. Here we reanalyze results of these data syntheses and outline why this conclusion is unfounded. First, we show the datasets collated for these syntheses are spatially biased and not representative of the spatial distribution of species richness or the distribution of many primary drivers of biodiversity change. This casts doubt that their results are representative of global patterns. Second, we argue that detecting the trend in local species richness is very difficult with short time series and can lead to biased estimates of change. Reanalyses of the data detected a signal of study duration on biodiversity change, indicating net biodiversity loss is most apparent in studies of longer duration. Third, estimates of species richness change can be biased if species gains during post-d\-isturbance recovery are included without also including species losses that occurred during the disturbance. Net species gains or losses should be assessed with respect to common baselines or reference communities. Ultimately, we need a globally coordinated effort to monitor biodiversity so that we can estimate and attribute human impacts as causes of biodiversity change. A combination of technologies will be needed to produce regularly updated global datasets of local biodiversity change to guide future policy. At this time the conclusion that there is no net change in local species richness is not the consensus state of knowledge.},

  abstract = {High resolution remote sensing data facilitate the use of small-scale habitat features such as trees or hedges in the analysis of species\textendash{}habitat relationships. Such data potentially enable more accurate species\textendash{}habitat mapping than lower resolution data. Here, for the first time, we systematically investigated this hypothesis by altering the spatial resolution from 1 m up to 1000 m grain size in species\textendash{}habitat models of 13 bird species. The study area covered the Nidda river catchment in central Germany, a large heterogeneous landscape of 1620 km2. A high resolution habitat map of the area was converted to coarser spatial and thematic resolutions in seven steps. We investigated how model performance responded to grain size, and we compared the differential effects of spatial resolution and thematic resolution on model performance. Explained deviance (D2) of the bird models generally decreased with coarser spatial resolution of the data, although it did not decrease monotonically in all species. On average across all species, model D2 decreased from 41.5 at 1 m grain size to 15.9 at 1000 m grain size. Ten species were best modelled at 1 m, two species at 3 m and one species at 32 m grain size. Model performance degraded continuously with increasing grain size, both in habitat generalist and habitat specialist bird species, and was systematically lower in habitat generalists. The higher model performance observed at finer grain sizes was most likely caused by the combination of three factors: (1) high spatial accuracy of bird records and (2) a more precise location and delineation of habitat features and, (3) to a lesser degree, by more habitat types differentiated in maps of finer resolution. We conclude that higher spatial and thematic resolution data can be essential for deriving accurate predictions on bird distribution patterns from species\textendash{}habitat models. Especially for bird species that are sensitive to specific land-use types or to small-scaled habitat features, a grain size of 1\textendash{}3 m seems most promising.},

In a constant environment, compensatory dynamics between species can maintain food web stability, but factors that synchronize population fluctuations within and between communities are expected to be destabilizing. We studied the dynamics of a food web in a metacommunity to determine how environmental variability and dispersal affect stability by altering compensatory dynamics and average species abundance. When dispersal rate is high, weak correlated environmental fluctuations promote food web stability by reducing the amplitude of compensatory dynamics. However, when dispersal rate is low, weak environmental fluctuations reduce food web stability by inducing intraspecific synchrony across communities. Irrespective of dispersal rate, strong environmental fluctuations disrupt compensatory dynamics and decrease stability by inducing intermittent correlated fluctuations between consumers in local food webs, which reduce both total consumer abundance and predator abundance. Strong correlated environmental fluctuations lead to (i) spatially asynchronous and highly correlated local consumer dynamics when dispersal is low and (ii) spatially synchronous but intermediate local consumer correlation when dispersal is high. By controlling intraspecific synchrony, dispersal mediates the capacity of strong environmental fluctuations to disrupt compensatory dynamics at both local and metacommunity scales.},

  abstract = {Abstract Aim Several models have predicted that, with climate change, Northern Hemisphere species will migrate northwards from their present distribution ranges. Sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marshall) reaches its northern continuous distributional limit in north-eastern North America at the transition between boreal mixed-wood and temperate deciduous forest. Our objective was to determine whether lower sugar maple recruitment potential accounts for this gradual transition between the continuous and discontinuous zones of the distribution. Location The northern limit of sugar maple in eastern Canada. Methods We analysed the reproductive capacity of sugar maple populations along three latitudinal transects (located in the west, centre and east of Qu{\'e}bec) in 24 sites located between 45\textdegree{}51??48\textdegree{}59?~N and 70\textdegree{}21??79\textdegree{}27?~W. The study area was divided into two zones, continuous and discontinuous, based on sugar maple stand abundance. We examined stand structure, sugar maple seed abundance and germination, and sugar maple seedling density and age structure. Results Sugar maple regeneration was uneven-aged and similar between continuous (south) and discontinuous (north) zones. For the western transect, more filled seeds and more seedlings were recorded in the continuous zone than in the discontinuous zone. Sugar maple seedling density was positively influenced by (1) basal area of mature sugar maple and saplings of all species, and (2) July mean temperature and precipitation. Four mast seed years were identified that were well synchronized across all sites; mast seeding covaried significantly with July mean temperature and July mean precipitation of the previous year. Main conclusions Our study clearly demonstrated an effect of climatic variables and stand characteristics on sugar maple regeneration. However, these factors did not explain the transition from a continuous to a discontinuous distribution for this species. Most of our northern sites exhibited constant sugar maple recruitment over time. These results highlight the importance of including non-climatic factors in models predicting species change in abundance.},

We derive a plant-based metaecosystem model to analyze how the spatial flows of the biotic and abiotic forms of a limiting nutrient affect persistence and coexistence. We show that the proportion of patches supporting plants in a region has a considerable impact on local nutrient dynamics. Then we explicitly couple nutrient dynamics to patch dynamics. Our model shows strong feedback between local and regional dynamics mediated by nutrient flows. We find that nutrient flows can have either positive or negative effects on species persistence and coexistence. The essential feature of this local-regional coupling is the net direction of the nutrient flows between occupied and empty patches. A net flow of nutrients from occupied to empty patches leads to indirect facilitative interactions, such as an inferior competitor promoting the persistence of a superior competitor. We show that nutrient flows affect the potential diversity of the metaecosystem and key features of plant community dynamics, such as the shape of the competition-colonization trade-off and successional sequences. Our analysis revealed that integrating ecosystem and spatial dynamics can lead to various indirect interactions that contribute significantly to community organization.},

From this model, we predict and test whether the relative importance of niche vs. neutral processes in controlling community dynamics will vary depending on community species richness, niche overlap and dispersal capabilities of species (both local and long distance). Results demonstrate that niche and neutrality form ends of a continuum from competitive to stochastic exclusion. In the absence of immigration, competitive exclusion tends to create a regular spacing of niches. However, immigration prevents the establishment of a limiting similarity. The equilibrium community consists of a set of complementary and redundant species, with their abundance determined, respectively, by the distribution of environmental conditions and the amount of immigration.},

We analyze a model for meta-ecosystem dynamics in a heterogeneous environment to study how the spatial flows of materials such as inorganic nutrients and nutrients sequestered into producers, herbivores, and detritus affect the community dynamics. We show that spatial flows of an inorganic nutrient (direct nutrient flow) and organic matter (indirect nutrient flow) through detritus, producer, or herbivore compartments can reverse the source\textendash{}sink dynamics of a local ecosystem. More precisely, the balance between such direct and indirect nutrient flows determines the net direction of nutrient flows between two ecosystems of contrasted productivities. It allows a sink to turn into a source and vice versa. This effect of nutrient flows on source and sink dynamics is robust to the ecosystem structure (with and without herbivores) and to specific ecosystem compartments contributing to nutrient flows (primary producers, herbivores, or detritus). Ecosystems in distinct localities thus interact together with the structure at one place influencing that of the other. In metaecosystems, the source\textendash{}sink dynamics of an organism is not only constrained by its dispersal from the source to the sink, but also by the fertility and community composition in the neighborhood responsible for spatial flows of nutrients and energy. The meta-ecosystem perspective provides a powerful theoretical framework to address novel questions in spatial ecosystem ecology.},

The present study demonstrates the usefulness of eigenfunctions in spatial modeling applied to ecological problems and shows equivalencies of and differences between the two current implementations of this methodology. The two approaches in this category are the distancebased (DB) eigenvector maps proposed by P. Legendre and his colleagues, and spatial filtering based upon geographic connectivity matrices (i.e., topology-based; CB) developed by D. A. Griffith and his colleagues. In both cases, the goal is to create spatial predictors that can be easily incorporated into conventional regression models. One important advantage of these two approaches over any other spatial approach is that they provide a flexible tool that allows the full range of general and generalized linear modeling theory to be applied to ecological and geographical problems in the presence of nonzero spatial autocorrelation.},

To determine Plasmodium vivax infection spread in north-eastern Venezuela, we used the State Transition Index (STI) to detect the spatial locations of malaria incidence boundaries and their dynamics over time. Then, we evaluated the role of population size on disease persistence. Boundary locations of malaria were found to be highly spatially variable. Waves of infection were observed in the spatial mosaics of large and small nearby localities due to a strong asynchrony in the epidemic dynamics between both host populations. Our results suggest that the epidemic spatial diffusion follows a hierarchy from large, populated villages (with few or no seasonal parasite fadeouts) to smaller, less populated localities, where infection outbreak was irregular or disease dynamics showed frequent fadeouts. Our findings stress the importance of malaria surveillance and control in these larger communities.},

  abstract = {Background: In the context of ecosystem management, the present study aims to compare the natural and the present-day forested landscapes of a large territory in Quebec (Canada). Using contemporary and long-term fire cycles, each natural forest landscape is defined according to the variability of its structure and composition, and compared to the present-day landscape. This analysis was conducted to address the question of whether human activities have moved these ecosystems outside the range of natural landscape variability.
Methods: The study encompassed a forested area of 175 000 km2 divided into 14 landscapes. Using a framework that integrates fire cycles, age structure and forest dynamics, we characterized the forest composition and age structures that resulted from three historical fire cycles (110, 140, and 180 years) representative of the boreal forest of eastern Canada. The modeled natural landscapes were compared with present-day landscapes in regard to the proportion of old-growth forests (landscape level) and the proportion of late-successional forest stands (landscape level and potential vegetation type).
Results: Four landscapes (39\%) remain within their natural range of variability. In contrast, nine landscapes (54\%) show a large gap between natural and present-day landscapes. These nine are located in the southern portion of the study area, and are mainly associated with Abies-Betula vegetation where human activities have contributed to a strong increase in the proportion of Populus tremuloides stands (early-successional stages) and a decrease of oldgrowth forest stands (more than 100 years old). A single landscape (7\%), substantially changed from its potential natural state, is a candidate for adaptive-based management.
Conclusion: Comparison of corresponding natural (reference conditions) and present-day landscapes showed that ten landscapes reflecting an important shift in forest composition and age structure could be considered beyond the range of their natural variability. The description of a landscape's natural variability at the scale of several millennia can be considered a moving benchmark that can be re-evaluated in the context of climate change. Focusing on regional landscape characteristics and long-term natural variability of vegetation and forest age structure represents a step forward in methodology for defining reference conditions and following shifts in landscape over time.},

Habitat trees, which typically provide many microhabitats such as hollows, crown dead wood, etc., are therefore selected to maintain those structural attributes within managed forests. To what extent the occurrence of microhabitats on potential habitat trees may be predicted from common tree attributes is a question of high practical relevance. Until now, most studies have attempted to predict the quantity of microhabitats at the tree or forest stand level. In our study, we aimed at explaining microhabitat occurrence from a qualitative perspective by considering their diversity. Tree diameter at breast height (dbh), tree species, and canopy class were useful predictors of microhabitat diversity. Microhabitat diversity on broadleaved trees was on average higher than in conifers of the same diameter. In contrast to microhabitat quantity, microhabitat diversity saturated towards higher dbh levels. Microhabitat diversity in beech trees of lower tree canopy classes was found to be surprisingly high. Habitat trees support not only more, but also more diverse, microhabitats in comparison to crop trees. Considering these findings on microhabitat distribution, the selection of habitat trees within Central European mixed mountain forests can be significantly improved.},

Although not meant to be an exhaustive review, we identify several important issues with tentative solutions where they exist (e.g. dealing with collinearity amongst predictors; how to compute model-averaged parameters) and highlight areas for future research where solutions are not clear (e.g. when to use random intercepts or slopes; which information criteria to use when random factors are involved). We also provide a worked example of a mixed model analysis of inbreeding depression in a wild population. By providing an overview of these issues, we hope that this approach will become more accessible to those investigating any process where multiple variables impact an evolutionary or ecological response.},

Dendroclimatological methods revealed the main influencing climate variables. The radial growth of beech is mainly determined by the late summer conditions from the previous year. The July temperature has become increasingly more important since the 1950s and even more significant since the 1990s. Before the 1950s, the main factor for spruce growth was the summer precipitation. This influence has nearly vanished, and the spruce trees react more distinctly to temperature of the previous summer. This shift in the climate signal indicates a sensitive response of spruce growth to changed conditions and points to a distinctly increased sensitiveness of spruce under future conditions. The competition interactions between mainly dominating spruce and mostly subordinate beech are already changing. European beech growth potential could benefit from warm summers and prolonged vegetation periods and increase its mean diameter in relation to spruce. In contrast, Norway spruce is more threatened by increased abiotic and biotic disturbances. The higher competitive vigour and changed vitality of beech and the lower vitality of spruce may alter the distribution boundaries of both species in Sweden.},

Here, we provide an overview of recent advances in this field, discuss the ecological principles and assumptions underpinning SDMs, and highlight critical limitations and decisions inherent in the construction and evaluation of SDMs. Particular emphasis is given to the use of SDMs for the assessment of climate change impacts and conservation management issues. We suggest new avenues for incorporating species migration, population dynamics, biotic interactions and community ecology into SDMs at multiple spatial scales.

Ecological resilience was defined as the amount of disturbance that an ecosystem could withstand without changing self-organized processes and structures (defined as alternative stable states). Other authors consider resilience as a return time to a stable state following a perturbation. A new term, adaptive capacity, is introduced to describe the processes that modify ecological resilience. Two definitions recognize the presence of multiple stable states (or stability domains), and hence resilience is the property that mediates transition among these states. Transitions among stable states have been described for many ecosystems, including semi-arid rangelands, lakes, coral reefs, and forests. In these systems, ecological resilience is maintained by keystone structuring processes across a number of scales, sources of renewal and reformation, and functional biodiversity. In practice, maintaining a capacity for renewal in a dynamic environment provides an ecological buffer that protects the system from the failure of management actions that are taken based upon incomplete understanding, and it allows managers to affordably learn and change.},

We extend the definition to the case of more than two classes by averaging pairwise comparisons. This measure reduces to the standard form in the two class case. We compare its properties with the standard measure of proportion correct and an alternative definition of proportion correct based on pairwise comparison of classes for a simple artificial case and illustrate its application on eight data sets. On the data sets we examined, the measures produced similar, but not identical results, reflecting the different aspects of performance that they were measuring. Like the area under the ROC curve, the measure we propose is useful in those many situations where it is impossible to give costs for the different kinds of misclassification.},

These assumptions are frequently incompatible. Levins' model is modified to allow for a varying difference between the local and regional time scales, and regional competition between two species is analyzed with the new model. The main results are that two like species may or may not coexist regionally, depending on the difference between the time scales (a large difference facilitates coexistence) and on the intensity of competition; a species' precompetitive distribution is a good predictor of its competitive success, just as the carrying capacity in the Lotka-Volterra model is a good predictor of success in local competition. Regional priority effect is possible, though unlikely when the time scales are very different. The local time scale is slower than the regional one in some organisms (e.g., orchids, ferns), which may survive regionally, although they may succeed in breeding only seldom. Two possible outcomes of regional competition are (I) a decrease in the fraction of habitat patches occupied by the competing species and (2) an increase in the proportion of regionally rare species, some of which may ultimately go extinct. I ask which of the two outcomes is more frequent in nature and suggest that the answer may depend on the time scales of local and regional population dynamics.},

The latter theory largely replaced the former one in the 1980s, especially in conservation applications. It is only recently that ecologists have fully realized that a relatively simple general theory can be readily constructed that makes some of the simplifying assumptions of the two earlier theories unnecessary. The spatially realistic metapopulation theory thereby provides a more unified framework for spatial ecology than the island theory or the classical metapopulation theory. This article describes the application of the spatially realistic metapopulation theory to real metapopulations living in highly fragmented landscapes. I discuss the principal messages for population ecology and conservation biology, and I also place this theory into a broader context of other approaches to spatial ecology.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic activities are causing widespread degradation of ecosystems worldwide, threatening the ecosystem services upon which all human life depends. Improved understanding of this degradation is urgently needed to improve avoidance and mitigation measures. One tool to assist these efforts is predictive models of ecosystem structure and function that are mechanistic: based on fundamental ecological principles. Here we present the first mechanistic General Ecosystem Model (GEM) of ecosystem structure and function that is both global and applies in all terrestrial and marine environments. Functional forms and parameter values were derived from the theoretical and empirical literature where possible. Simulations of the fate of all organisms with body masses between 10 mg and 150,000 kg (a range of 14 orders of magnitude) across the globe led to emergent properties at individual (e.g., growth rate), community (e.g., biomass turnover rates), ecosystem (e.g., trophic pyramids), and macroecological scales (e.g., global patterns of trophic structure) that are in general agreement with current data and theory. These properties emerged from our encoding of the biology of, and interactions among, individual organisms without any direct constraints on the properties themselves. Our results indicate that ecologists have gathered sufficient information to begin to build realistic, global, and mechanistic models of ecosystems, capable of predicting a diverse range of ecosystem properties and their response to human pressures.},

Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

Response to climate warming over the last century, however, has been mixed, with some treelines showing evidence of recruitment at higher altitudes and/or latitudes (advance) whereas others reveal no marked change in the upper limit of tree establishment. To explore this variation, we analysed a global dataset of 166 sites for which treeline dynamics had been recorded since 1900 AD. Advance was recorded at 52\% of sites with only 1\% reporting treeline recession. Treelines that experienced strong winter warming were more likely to have advanced, and treelines with a diffuse form were more likely to have advanced than those with an abrupt or krummholz form. Diffuse treelines may be more responsive to warming because they are more strongly growth limited, whereas other treeline forms may be subject to additional constraints.},

  abstract = {Bottom trawl survey data are commonly used as a sampling technique to assess the spatial distribution of commercial species. However, this sampling technique does not always correctly detect a species even when it is present, and this can create significant limitations when fitting species distribution models. In this study, we aim to test the relevance of a mixed methodological approach that combines presence-only and presence-absence distribution models. We illustrate this approach using bottom trawl survey data to model the spatial distributions of 27 commercially targeted marine species. We use an environmentally- and geographically-weighted method to simulate pseudo-absence data. The species distributions are modelled using regression kriging, a technique that explicitly incorporates spatial dependence into predictions. Model outputs are then used to identify areas that met the conservation targets for the deployment of artificial anti-trawling reefs. To achieve this, we propose the use of a fuzzy logic framework that accounts for the uncertainty associated with different model predictions. For each species, the predictive accuracy of the model is classified as `high'. A better result is observed when a large number of occurrences are used to develop the model. The map resulting from the fuzzy overlay shows that three main areas have a high level of agreement with the conservation criteria. These results align with expert opinion, confirming the relevance of the proposed methodology in this study.},

  abstract = {We examined tree species responses under forest harvesting and an increased fire disturbance scenario due to climate warming in northern Wisconsin where northern hardwood and boreal forests are currently predominant. Individual species response at the ecosystem scale was simulated with a gap model, which integrates soil, climate and species data, stratified by ecoregions. Such responses were quantified as species establishment coefficients. These coefficients were used to parameterize a spatially explicit landscape model, LANDIS. Species response to climate warming at the landscape scale was simulated with LANDIS, which integrates ecosystem dynamics with spatial processes including seed dispersal, fire disturbance, and forest harvesting. Under a 5 8C annual temperature increase predicted by global climate models (GCM), our simulation results suggest that significant change in species composition and abundance could occur in the two ecoregions in the study area. In the glacial lake plain (lakeshore) ecoregion under warming conditions, boreal and northern hardwood species such as red oak, sugar maple, white pine, balsam fir, paper birch, yellow birch, and aspen decline gradually during and after climate warming. Southern species such as white ash, hickory, bur oak, black oak, and white oak, which are present in minor amounts before the warming, increase in abundance on the landscape. The transition of the northern hardwood and boreal forest to one dominated by southern species occurs around year 200. In the sand barrens ecoregion under warming conditions, red pine initially benefits from the decline of other northern hardwood species, and its abundance quickly increases. However, red pine and jack pine as well as new southern species are unable to reproduce, and the ecoregion could transform into a region with only grass and shrub species around 250 years under warming climate. Increased fire frequency can accelerate the decline of shadetolerant species such as balsam fir and sugar maple and accelerate the northward migration of southern species. Forest harvesting accelerated the decline of northern hardwood and boreal tree species. This is especially obvious on the barrens ecoregion, where the intensive cutting regime contributed to the decline of red pine and jack pine already under stressed environments. Forest managers may instead consider a conservative cutting plan or protective management scenarios with limited forest harvesting. This could prolong the transformation of the barrens into prairie from one-half to one tree life cycle. \# 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The main objective of this paper is to consider the validity of current harvesting techniques applied to the mixed forest of Qu{\'e}bec. The old-growth mixed forest naturally regenerates by gap dynamics. However, the harvesting technique most commonly used in the mixed forest is clearcutting, with the result that succession must start over from the beginning. A general forest succession model applicable after such large disturbances is proposed. The most positive estimate indicates that the mixed forest will not be re-established earlier than 250 years after clearcutting. To ensure sustainable development in the mixed forest, harvesting techniques should imitate natural regeneration processes.

  abstract = {Climate envelope models (CEMs) have been used to predict the distribution of species under current, past, and future climatic conditions by inferring a species' environmental requirements from localities where it is currently known to occur. CEMs can be evaluated for their ability to predict current species distributions but it is unclear whether models that are successful in predicting current distributions are equally successful in predicting distributions under different climates (i.e. different regions or time periods). We evaluated the ability of CEMs to predict species distributions under different climates by comparing their predictions with those obtained with a mechanistic model (MM). In an MM the distribution of a species is modeled based on knowledge of a species' physiology. The potential distributions of 100 plant species were modeled with an MM for current conditions, a past climate reconstruction (21 000 years before present) and a future climate projection (double preindustrial CO2 conditions). Point localities extracted from the currently suitable area according to the MM were used to predict current, future, and past distributions with four CEMs covering a broad range of statistical approaches: Bioclim (percentile distributions), Domain (distance metric), GAM (general additive modeling), and Maxent (maximum entropy). Domain performed very poorly, strongly underestimating range sizes for past or future conditions. Maxent and GAM performed as well under current climates as under past and future climates. Bioclim slightly underestimated range sizes but the predicted ranges overlapped more with the ranges predicted with the MM than those predicted with GAM did. Ranges predicted with Maxent overlapped most with those produced with the MMs, but compared with the ranges predicted with GAM they were more variable and sometimes much too large. Our results suggest that some CEMs can indeed be used to predict species distributions under climate change, but individual modeling approaches should be validated for this purpose, and model choice could be made dependent on the purpose of a particular study.},

  abstract = {We developed interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas (excluding Antarctica) at a spatial resolution of 30 arc s (often referred to as 1-km spatial resolution). The climate elements considered were monthly precipitation and mean, minimum, and maximum temperature. Input data were gathered from a variety of sources and, where possible, were restricted to records from the 1950\textendash{}2000 period. We used the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in the ANUSPLIN package for interpolation, using latitude, longitude, and elevation as independent variables. We quantified uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation by mapping weather station density, elevation bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation. Elevation bias tended to be negative (stations lower than expected) at high latitudes but positive in the tropics. Uncertainty is highest in mountainous and in poorly sampled areas. Data partitioning showed high uncertainty of the surfaces on isolated islands, e.g. in the Pacific. Aggregating the elevation and climate data to 10 arc min resolution showed an enormous variation within grid cells, illustrating the value of high-resolution surfaces. A comparison with an existing data set at 10 arc min resolution showed overall agreement, but with significant variation in some regions. A comparison with two high-resolution data sets for the United States also identified areas with large local differences, particularly in mountainous areas. Compared to previous global climatologies, ours has the following advantages: the data are at a higher spatial resolution (400 times greater or more); more weather station records were used; improved elevation data were used; and more information about spatial patterns of uncertainty in the data is available. Owing to the overall low density of available climate stations, our surfaces do not capture of all variation that may occur at a resolution of 1 km, particularly of precipitation in mountainous areas. In future work, such variation might be captured through knowledgebased methods and inclusion of additional co-variates, particularly layers obtained through remote sensing.

  abstract = {In this paper we ask whether succession in a rocky subtidal community varies in space and time, and if so how much affect that variation has on predictions of community dynamics and structure. We describe succession by Markov chain models based on observed frequencies of species replacements. We use loglinear analysis to detect and quantify spatio-temporal variation in the transition matrices describing succession. The analysis shows that space and time, but not their interaction, have highly significant effects on transition probabilities. To explore the ecological importance of the spatio-temporal variability detected in this analysis, we compare the equilibria and the transient dynamics among three Markov chain models: a time-averaged model that includes the effects of space on succession, a spatially averaged model that include the effects of time, and a constant matrix that averages over the effects of space and time. All three models predicted similar equilibrium composition and similar rates of convergence to equilibrium, as measured by the damping ratio or the subdominant Lyapunov exponent. The predicted equilibria from all three models were very similar to the observed community structure. Thus, although spatial and temporal variation is statistically significant, at least in this system this variation does not prevent homogeneous models from predicting community structure.},

At local scales, the distribution of many species is influenced by the interplay of the three factors of habitat availability, local extinctions and colonization dynamics. We use the standard Levins metapopulation model to illustrate how gradients in these three factors can generate species' range limits. We suggest that the three routes to range limits have radically different evolutionary implications. Because the Levins model makes simplifying assumptions about the spatial coupling of local populations, we present numerical studies of spatially explicit metapopulation models that complement the analytical model. The three routes to range limits give rise to distinct spatiotemporal patterns. Range limits in one species can also arise because of environmental gradients impinging upon other species. We briefly discuss a predator{$\pm$}prey example, which illustrates indirect routes to range limits in a metacommunity context.},

  abstract = {Partitioning of tree mortality into different modes of death allows the tracing and mechanistic modelling of individual key processes of forest dynamics each varying depending on site, species and individual risk factors. This, in turn, may improve long-term predictions of the development of old-growth forests. Six different individual tree mortality modes (uprooted and snapped (both with or without rot as a predisposing factor), standing dead and crushed by other trees) were analysed, and statistical models were derived for three tree species (European beech Fagus sylvatica, hornbeam Carpinus betulus and common ash Fraxinus excelsior) based on a repeated inventory of more than 13 000 trees in a 28 ha near-natural deciduous forest in Central Germany. The frequently described U-shaped curve of size-dependent mortality was observed in beech and hornbeam (but not ash) and could be explained by the joint operation of processes related to the six distinct mortality modes. The results for beech, the most abundant species, suggest that each mortality mode is prevalent in different life-history stages: small trees died mostly standing or being crushed, medium-sized trees had the highest chance of survival, and very large trees experienced increased rates of mortality, mainly by uprooting or snapping. Reduced growth as a predictor also played a role but only for standing dead, all other mortality modes showed no relationship to tree growth. Synthesis. Tree mortality can be partitioned into distinct processes, and species tend to differ in their susceptibility to one or more of them. This forms a fundamental basis for the understanding of forest dynamics in natural forests, and any mechanistic modelling of mortality in vegetation models could be improved by correctly addressing and formulating the various mortality processes.},

However, sunscald is common in sugar maple stands with damaged crowns, sometimes resulting in infection by the sap rot fungus Cerrena unicolor. Fungi of the genera Ophiostoma, Ceratocystis and Ceratocystiopsis (blue stains) can cause significant staining to standing timber in damaged softwood stands; however, these fungi do not cause structural damage. Bark beetles (scolytidae) and wood-borers (buprestidae and cerambycidae), which attack damaged trees in northeastern North America are normally secondary invaders.

  abstract = {Continuous-time Markov models are commonly used to analyze longitudinal transitions between multiple disease states in panel data, where participants' disease states are only observed at multiple time points, and the exact state paths between observations are unknown. However, when covariate effects are incorporated and allowed to vary for different transitions, the number of potential parameters to estimate can become large even when the number of covariates is moderate, and traditional maximum likelihood estimation and subset model selection procedures can easily become unstable due to overfitting. We propose a novel regularized continuous-time Markov model with the elastic net penalty, which is capable of simultaneous variable selection and estimation for large number of parameters. We derive an efficient coordinate descent algorithm to solve the penalized optimization problem, which is fully automatic and data driven. We further consider an extension where one of the states is death, and time of death is exactly known but the state path leading to death is unknown. The proposed method is extensively evaluated in a simulation study, and demonstrated in an application to real-world data on airflow limitation state transitions.},

We compared three contiguous sites differing in fire history to explore post-fire succession of collembolan (Hexapoda: Apterygota) communities in a maple-oak forest in southern Qu{\'e}bec, Canada. We found a total of 22 collembolan species from 8 families and 17 genera at sites burned 0, {$\sim$}50, and {$\sim$}100 years in the past; samples from the most recent fire were collected in both lightly and intensely burned patches. Shifts in community composition were significantly related to time since a fire disturbance, burn intensity, and consumption of litter and organic soil horizons during recent fire events. Using a trait-based approach we demonstrate that species that remain following high-intensity fire are smaller-bodied than species in unburned areas. Additional character states (eyeless, unpigmented) suggest these species are endogeaic versus epigeaic, and that litter loss associated with high-intensity fire is the main driver of collembolan community compositional changes. We suggest that understanding Collembola community dynamics in response to a fire disturbance will require a better understanding of the spatial configuration of remnant habitat patches within heterogeneous burn sites, and patterns of collembolan dispersal and recolonization in three dimensional space.},

Using a greater variety of silvicultural systems to emulate a range of historical disturbances may help to restore historical mid-tolerant species abundance and tree diversity. To test the link between seedling recruitment and sapling recruitment and disturbance-based management systems, we implemented a novel silvicultural experiment using a variety of harvest and site preparation treatments ranging from single-tree selection to clear-cut and scarification, which emulate regionally-specific natural disturbance regimes. We predicted that mid-severity harvest treatments would promote mid-tolerant sapling recruitment, while scarification and the creation of pit-mound topography would favor recruitment of small-seeded species such as yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.). We found that seedling and sapling composition was related to silvicultural treatment and driven by an opposing gradient of canopy openness and leaf litter depth along with temporal soil water content variation. Yellow birch seedling density, however, had little relation to silvicultural treatment but was instead predicted by positive relationships with leaf litter depth variation and residual conspecific basal area. Our findings suggest that silvicultural systems aimed at promoting species diversity in northern hardwoods should consider, along with conventional techniques, modifying litter depth and canopy openness while retaining seed trees.},

Describing size-specific mortality patterns can be especially difficult, due to few trees in larger size classes. We used permanent plot data from Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides (mountain beech) forest on the eastern slopes of the Southern Alps, New Zealand, where the fates of trees on 250 plots of 0.04 ha were followed, to examine: (1) patterns of size-specific mortality over three consecutive periods spanning 30 years, each characterised by different disturbance, and (2) the strength and direction of neighbourhood crowding effects on size-specific mortality rates. We found that the size-specific mortality function was U-shaped over the 30-year period as well as within two shorter periods characterised by small-scale pinhole beetle and windthrow disturbance. During a third period, characterised by earthquake disturbance, tree mortality was less size dependent. Small trees ({$<$}20 cm in diameter) were more likely to die, in all three periods, if surrounded by a high basal area of larger neighbours, suggesting that size-asymmetric competition for light was a major cause of mortality. In contrast, large trees ({$\geq$}20 cm in diameter) were more likely to die in the first period if they had few neighbours, indicating that positive crowding effects were sometimes important for survival of large trees. Overall our results suggest that temporal variability in size-specific mortality patterns, and positive interactions between large trees, may sometimes need to be incorporated into models of forest dynamics.},

The recurring suggestions are that models should explicitly (i) include spatiotemporal dynamics; (ii) consider multiple species in interactions and (iii) account for the processes shaping biodiversity distribution. This article presents a biodiversity model (FATE-HD) that meets this challenge at regional scale by combining phenomenological and process-based approaches and using well-defined plant functional groups. FATE-HD has been tested and validated in a French National Park, demonstrating its ability to simulate vegetation dynamics, structure and diversity in response to disturbances and climate change. The analysis demonstrated the importance of considering biotic interactions, spatio-temporal dynamics and disturbances in addition to abiotic drivers to simulate vegetation dynamics. The distribution of pioneer trees was particularly improved, as were all undergrowth functional groups.},

  abstract = {We modeled and mapped, using the predictive data mining tool Random Forests, 134 tree species from the eastern United States for potential response to several scenarios of climate change. Each species was modeled individually to show current and potential future habitats according to two emission scenarios (high emissions on current trajectory and reasonable conservation of energy implemented) and three climate models: the Parallel Climate Model, the Hadley CM3 model, and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory model. Since we model potential suitable habitats of species, our results should not be interpreted as actual changes in ranges of the species. We also evaluated both emission scenarios under an ``average'' future climate from all three models. Climate change could have large impacts on suitable habitat for tree species in the eastern United States, especially under a high emissions trajectory. Of the 134 species, approximately 66 species would gain and 54 species would lose at least 10\% of their suitable habitat under climate change. A lower emission pathway would result in lower numbers of both losers and gainers. When the mean centers, i.e. center of gravity, of current and potential future habitat are evaluated, most of the species habitat moves generally northeast, up to 800 km in the hottest scenario and highest emissions trajectory. The models suggest a retreat of the spruce-fir zone and an advance of the southern oaks and pines. In any case, our results show that species will have a lot less pressure to move their suitable habitats if we follow the path of lower emissions of greenhouse gases. The information contained in this paper, and much more, is detailed on our website: http://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/atlas.},

  abstract = {Aim We describe and use a model, SHIFT, to estimate potential migration due to climate change over the next 100 years. Location Eastern United States. Methods Five species, currently confined to the eastern half of the United States and not extending into Canada, were used to assess migration potential: Diospyros virginiana (persimmon), Liquidambar styraciflua (sweetgum), Oxydendrum arboreum (sourwood), Pinus taeda (loblolly pine), and Quercus falcata var. falcata (southern red oak). SHIFT is a matrix simulation model using simple inverse power functions to provide a distance decay of seed dispersal and is driven primarily by the abundance of the species near the boundary, the forest density within and beyond the boundary, and the distance between cells. For each cell outside the current boundary, the model creates an estimate of the probability that each unoccupied cell will become colonized over a period of 100 years. SHIFT is a `fat-tailed' migration model that allows rare very long distance dispersal events and colonization could occur up to 500 km beyond the current distribution boundary. Model outputs were analysed using transects through sections showing relatively low and high colonization probabilities as a result of low and high densities of target trees (high source strength) as well as high densities of forest (high sink strength). We also assess migration potential for species by concentric rings around the current boundary. Results Model outputs show the generally limited nature of migration for all five species over 100 years. There is a relatively high probability of colonization within a zone of 10\textendash{}20 km (depending on habitat quality and species abundance) from the current boundary, but a small probability of colonization where the distance from the current boundary exceeds about 20 km. Whether biologically plausible or not, rare very long distance migration events are not sufficient to rescue migration. Species abundance (the source strength of migration) near the range boundary carried relatively more influence than percentage forest cover (sink strength) in determining migration rates. Main conclusion The transect evaluation revealed the importance of abundance of the species near the boundary, indicating that rare species may have much more difficulty in unassisted northward migration due to climate change. The concentric rings analysis of the model outputs showed that only the first 10\textendash{}20 km of area would have a reasonably high probability of colonization. Rare, long-distance events permit colonization of remote outliers, but much more needs to be understood about the likelihood of these rare events to predict the frequency of outlier establishment.},

Next, we review two broad categories of methods, focused on the spatial domain, for modeling potential range shifts and future suitable habitat: empirical species-distribution models and more process-based simulations. We propose long-term demography studies as a complementary approach in the time domain when sufficient data are available. Dispersal and successful migration into newly suitable habitat are key mechanisms constraining range shifts. We review three approaches to estimating these processes, followed by a discussion of the potential for assisted migration. We conclude that there have been significant recent advances on several fronts but there are still large uncertainties that need further research.},

This paper describes how to analyse the local stability of spatially homogeneous solutions in such systems. The spatial arrangement of the patches and their coupling is described by a matrix. For a local stability analysis of spatially homogeneous solutions it turns out to be sufficient to know the eigenvalues of this matrix. This is shown for both continuous and discrete time systems. A bookkeeping scheme is presented that facilitates stability analyses by reducing the analysis of a k-species, n-patch system to that of n uncoupled k-dimensional single-patch systems. This is demonstrated in a worked example for a chain of patches. In two applications the method is then used to analyse the stability of the equilibrium of a predator\textendash{}prey system with a pool of dispersers and of the periodic solutions of the spatial Lotka\textendash{}Volterra model.},

  abstract = {Numerous species have been pushed into extinction as an increasing portion of Earth's land surface has been appropriated for human enterprise. In the future, global biodiversity will be affected by both climate change and land-use change, the latter of which is currently the primary driver of species extinctions. How societies address climate change will critically affect biodiversity because climate-change mitigation policies will reduce direct climate-change impacts; however, these policies will influence land-use decisions, which could have negative impacts on habitat for a substantial number of species. We assessed the potential impact future climate policy could have on the loss of habitable area in biodiversity hotspots due to associated landuse changes. We estimated past extinctions from historical land-use changes (1500\textendash{}2005) based on the global gridded land-use data used for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report and habitat extent and species data for each hotspot. We then estimated potential extinctions due to future land-use changes under alternative climate-change scenarios (2005\textendash{}2100). Future land-use changes are projected to reduce natural vegetative cover by 26-58\% in the hotspots. As a consequence, the number of additional species extinctions, relative to those already incurred between 1500 and 2005, due to land-use change by 2100 across all hotspots ranged from about 220 to 21000 (0.2\% to 16\%), depending on the climate-change mitigation scenario and biological factors such as the slope of the species\textendash{}area relationship and the contribution of wood harvest to extinctions. These estimates of potential future extinctions were driven by land-use change only and likely would have been higher if the direct effects of climate change had been considered. Future extinctions could potentially be reduced by incorporating habitat preservation into scenario development to reduce projected future land-use changes in hotspots or by lessening the impact of future land-use activities on biodiversity within hotspots.},

Accurate species distribution models are useful for efficient and adaptive management and conservation, research, and ecological forecasting. Yet, these models are often presented without fully examining or explaining the caveats for their proper use and interpretation and are often implemented without understanding the limitations and assumptions of the model being used. We describe common pitfalls, assumptions, and caveats of correlative species distribution models to help novice users and end users better interpret these models. Four primary caveats corresponding to different phases of the modeling process, each with supporting documentation and examples, include: (1) all sampling data are incomplete and potentially biased; (2) predictor variables must capture distribution constraints; (3) no single model works best for all species, in all areas, at all spatial scales, and over time; and (4) the results of species distribution models should be treated like a hypothesis to be tested and validated with additional sampling and modeling in an iterative process.},

  abstract = {Abstract We propose four postulates as the minimum set of logical propositions necessary for a theory of pulse dynamics and disturbance in ecosystems: (1) resource dynamics characterizes the magnitude, rate, and duration of resource change caused by pulse events, including the continuing changes in resources that are the result of abiotic and biotic processes; (2) energy flux characterizes the energy flow that controls the variation in the rates of resource assimilation across ecosystems; (3) patch dynamics characterizes the distribution of resource patches over space and time, and the resulting patterns of biotic diversity, ecosystem structure, and cross-scale feedbacks of pulses processes; and (4) biotic trait diversity characterizes the evolutionary responses to pulse dynamics and, in turn, the way trait diversity affects ecosystem dynamics during and after pulse events. We apply the four postulates to an important class of pulse events, biomass-altering disturbances, and derive seven generalizations that predict disturbance magnitude, resource trajectory, rate of resource change, disturbance probability, biotic trait diversification at evolutionary scales, biotic diversity at ecological scales, and functional resilience. Ultimately, theory must define the variable combinations that result in dynamic stability, comprising resistance, recovery, and adaptation.},

The rationale is that populations in the core of their geographical or ecological ranges occupy suitable habitats and exhibit higher and less variable densities. Populations along the peripheries tend to be more fragmented and therefore less likely to receive immigrants from other populations. A population's probability of persistence is expected to correlate positively with habitat suitability and immigration rate and to correlate negatively with demographic variability. These predictions may be invalidated by the effect of threats, which may cause some peripheral populations to persist rather than populations in the core. We expect that predictions of persistence from core\textendash{}periphery models will be improved by incorporating information on threats, and illustrate one way in which threat could be integrated within quantitative area-selection methods. We illustrate this for Europe by showing that important areas for biodiversity, selected with presence data, have consistently more people than expected by chance, but that incorporating human density as a constraint to area selection can reduce substantially this level of pressure. We also show that areas selected using simple core\textendash{}periphery models have fewer people than areas selected with presence data only. These results support the idea that there are opportunities to identify important areas for the persistence of species that are located in areas with low human density.},

  abstract = {Abstract Predicting plant community responses to changing environmental conditions is a key element of forecasting and mitigating the effects of global change. Disturbance can play an important role in these dynamics, by initiating cycles of secondary succession and generating opportunities for communities of long-lived organisms to reorganize in alternative configurations. This study used landscape-scale variations in environmental conditions, stand structure, and disturbance from an extreme fire year in Alaska to examine how these factors affected successional trajectories in boreal forests dominated by black spruce. Because fire intervals in interior Alaska are typically too short to allow relay succession, the initial cohorts of seedlings that recruit after fire largely determine future canopy composition. Consequently, in a dynamically stable landscape, postfire tree seedling composition should resemble that of the prefire forest stands, with little net change in tree composition after fire. Seedling recruitment data from 90 burned stands indicated that postfire establishment of black spruce was strongly linked to environmental conditions and was highest at sites that were moist and had high densities of prefire spruce. Although deciduous broadleaf trees were absent from most prefire stands, deciduous trees recruited from seed at many sites and were most abundant at sites where the fires burned severely, consuming much of the surface organic layer. Comparison of pre- and postfire tree composition in the burned stands indicated that the expected trajectory of black spruce self-replacement was typical only at moist sites that burned with low fire severity. At severely burned sites, deciduous trees dominated the postfire tree seedling community, suggesting these sites will follow alternative, deciduous-dominated trajectories of succession. Increases in the severity of boreal fires with climate warming may catalyze shifts to an increasingly deciduous-dominated landscape, substantially altering landscape dynamics and ecosystem services in this part of the boreal forest.},

This study provides evidence of range expansion under current climatic conditions of an indigenous species with strong ecosystem effects. Surveys of stands along the northern distribution limit of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) in central Yukon Territory, Canada showed consistent increases in pine dominance following fire. These patterns differed strongly from those observed at sites where pine has been present for several thousand years. Differences in species thinning rates are unlikely to account for the observed increases in pine dominance. Rates of pine regeneration at its range limits were equivalent to those of spruce, indicating a capacity for rapid local population expansion. The study also found no evidence of strong climatic limitation of pine population growth at the northern distribution limit. We interpret these data as evidence of current pine expansion at its range limits and conclude that the northern distribution of lodgepole pine is not in equilibrium with current climate. This study has implications for our ability to predict vegetation response to climate change when populations may lag in their response to climate.},

Monthly data for the period 1961\textendash{}2100 were downloaded mainly from the web portal of Third Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (Phase 3) of the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) and subsets of data covering North America were extracted. Climate variables included monthly mean daily maximum and minimum temperatures, precipitation, incident surface solar radiation, wind speed, and specific humidity. All variables were expressed as changes relative to the simulated monthly means for 1961\textendash{}1990, which corrected for GCM bias in reproducing past climate and allowed future projected trends to be compared directly. The downscaling procedure used the ANUSPLIN software package to fit a two-dimensional spline function to each month's change data for each climate variable at a spatial resolution of 5 arcminutes (0.0833\textordmasculine{}) longitude and latitude. The A2 emission scenario invariably generated the greatest warming by 2100 and the B1 the least. Alaska is projected to undergo the greatest regional increases in temperature and precipitation. Differences across the projections were generally greater from the different GHG forcings than those resulting from the different GCMs, although the consistency varied spatially. Gridded datasets are publicly available. The downscaled change factors from this study are being used with historical climatology developed from the PRISM climate data set to develop the climate projections for the RPA scenarios in the USDA FS RPA assessment. A companion report and data set will be issued by Natural Resources Canada (Canadian Forest Service) for Canada.},

Here, we adopt the complementary log\textendash{}log (CLL) function for modeling permanent plot interval-censored individual tree survival data. The CLL function is derived directly from the likelihood function of a fully specified statistical model that accounts for interval censoring. In addition, our CLL model considers silvicultural treatment effects on survival. Our data are from young permanent plot loblolly pine plantations that have been measured annually beginning at age 1 year. Each plot was randomly assigned one of four cultural treatments: control (C), herbicide (H), fertilization (F), and herbicide and fertilization (HF). Here we extend the individual tree survival CLL model to allow for trees within a plot and plot level random effects.

Advances in the understanding of network patterns encourage the application of a network approach in other disciplines than theoretical ecology, such as biodiversity conservation. So far, however, practical applications have been meagre. Here we present a framework for network analysis to be harnessed to advance conservation management by using plant \textendash{} pollinator networks and islands as model systems. Conservation practitioners require indicators to monitor and assess management effectiveness and validate overall conservation goals. By distinguishing between two network attributes, the `diversity' and `distribution' of interactions, on three hierarchical levels (species, guild/ group and network) we identify seven quantitative metrics to describe changes in network patterns that have implications for conservation. Diversity metrics are partner diversity, vulnerability/generality, interaction diversity and interaction evenness, and distribution metrics are the specialization indices d{${'}$} and H2{${'}$} , and modularity. Distribution metrics account for sampling bias and may therefore be suitable indicators to detect human-induced changes to plant \textendash{}pollinator communities, thus indirectly assessing the structural and functional robustness and integrity of ecosystems. We propose an implementation pathway that outlines the stages that are required to successfully embed a network approach in biodiversity conservation. Most importantly, only if conservation action and study design are aligned by practitioners and ecologists through joint experiments, are the findings of a conservation network approach equally beneficial for advancing adaptive management and ecological network theory. We list potential obstacles to the framework, highlight the shortfall in empirical, mostly experimental, network data and discuss possible solutions.},

However, quantification of landscape change from vegetation development and disturbance effects is difficult because of the large space and long time scales involved. Comparative simulation modeling experiments, using a suite of models to simulate a set of scenarios, can provide a platform for investigating landscape change over more ecologically appropriate time and space scales that control vegetation and disturbance. We implemented a multifactorial simulation experiment using five landscape fire succession models to explore the role of fire and vegetation development under various climates on a neutral landscape. The simulation experiment had four factors with two or three treatments each: (1) fire (fire and no fire), (2) succession (dynamic and static succession), (3) climate (historical, warm-wet, warmdry), and (4) weather (constant, variable). We found that, under historical climates, succession changed more area annually than fire by factors of 1.2 to 34, but one model simulated more landscape change from fire (factor of 0.1). However, we also found that fire becomes more important in warmer future climates with factors decreasing to below zero for most models. We also found that there were few differences in simulation results between weather scenarios with low or high variability. Results from this study show that there will be a shift from vegetation processes that control today's landscape dynamics to fire processes under future warmer and drier climates, and this shift means that detailed representations of both succession and fire should be incorporated into models to realistically simulate interactions between disturbance and vegetation.},

Most approaches are correlative in that they statistically link spatial data to species distribution records. An alternative strategy is to explicitly incorporate the mechanistic links between the functional traits of organisms and their environments into SDMs. Here, we review how the principles of biophysical ecology can be used to link spatial data to the physiological responses and constraints of organisms. This provides a mechanistic view of the fundamental niche which can then be mapped to the landscape to infer range constraints. We show how physiologically based SDMs can be developed for different organisms in different environmental contexts. Mechanistic SDMs have different strengths and weaknesses to correlative approaches, and there are many exciting and unexplored prospects for integrating the two approaches. As physiological knowledge becomes better integrated into SDMs, we will make more robust predictions of range shifts in novel or non-equilibrium contexts such as invasions, translocations, climate change and evolutionary shifts.},

  abstract = {Organisms eating each other are only one of many types of well documented and important interactions among species. Other such types include habitat modification, predator interference and facilitation. However, ecological network research has been typically limited to either pure food webs or to networks of only a few ({$<$}3) interaction types. The great diversity of non-trophic interactions observed in nature has been poorly addressed by ecologists and largely excluded from network theory. Herein, we propose a conceptual framework that organises this diversity into three main functional classes defined by how they modify specific parameters in a dynamic food web model. This approach provides a path forward for incorporating non-trophic interactions in traditional food web models and offers a new perspective on tackling ecological complexity that should stimulate both theoretical and empirical approaches to understanding the patterns and dynamics of diverse species interactions in nature.},

We present the first effort, to our knowledge, describing a comprehensive ecological network that includes all known trophic and diverse non-trophic links among .100 coexisting species for the marine rocky intertidal community of the central Chilean coast. Our results suggest that non-trophic interactions exhibit highly nonrandom structures both alone and with respect to food web structure. The occurrence of different types of interactions, relative to all possible links, was well predicted by trophic structure and simple traits of the source and target species. In this community, competition for space and positive interactions related to habitat/refuge provisioning by sessile and/or basal species were by far the most abundant non-trophic interactions. If these patterns are corroborated in other ecosystems, they may suggest potentially important dynamic constraints on the combined architecture of trophic and non-trophic interactions. The nonrandom patterning of non-trophic interactions suggests a path forward for developing a more comprehensive ecological network theory to predict the functioning and resilience of ecological communities.},

  abstract = {Aim To evaluate whether seedlings of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) can establish beyond the species northern range limit in adjacent boreal forest. Location The hardwood\textendash{}boreal forest transition zone on the north-east shore of Lake Superior, Ontario, Canada. Methods Seed fall of sugar maple was monitored for 5 years in a stand of this species at its northern range limit, and seed from this stand was transplanted to five micro-habitat types in an adjacent boreal forest. The establishment and survival of sugar maple seedlings there, and in the seed-source stand, was monitored for the following 7\textendash{}11 years. Soil-surface light levels were measured in both forest types. Results Most seed fell in the final year of monitoring, when c. 250 seeds m-2 were recorded. First-year seedling establishment rates in the maple stand, deriving from this mast seed year, was approximately double that deriving from seed transplanted to the boreal forest sites; this is tentatively attributed to seed predator satiation in the maple stand. However, subsequent seedling survivorship in the boreal forest was greater than that in the maple stand, resulting in comparable seedling densities by the end of 6 years. This difference is tentatively attributed to better illumination in the boreal forest sites, and canopy-opening disturbances appear to be especially facilitative of seedling survival. Main conclusions There is no fundamental impediment to sugar maple seedlings establishing in boreal forest communities if climate warming occurs and seed is available. If management intervention is needed to accelerate seed availability in a rapidly warming boreal forest, then diffuse seed application to disturbed boreal forest sites during mast years of local boreal tree species is recommended as the most effective way of avoiding seed predation and increasing seedling survival.},

  abstract = {Studies examining the relationship between species richness and the productivity of ecological communities have taken one of two opposite viewpoints, viewing either productivity as a primary driver of richness or richness as a driver of productivity. Recently, verbal and graphical hypotheses have been proposed that attempt to merge these perspectives by clarifying the causal pathways that link resource supply, species richness, resource use, and biomass production. Here we present mathematical models that formalize how these pathways can operate simultaneously in a single ecological system. Using a metacommunity framework in which classic consumer-resource competition theory governs species interactions within patches, we show that the mechanisms by which resource supply influences species richness are inherently linked to the mechanisms by which species richness controls resource use and biomass production. Unlike prior hypotheses, our models show that resource supply can affect species richness and that richness can affect productivity simultaneously at a single spatial scale. Our models also reproduce scale-dependent associations between species richness and community biomass that have been reported elsewhere. By detailing the pathways by which resource supply, species richness, biomass production, and resource use are connected, our models move closer to resolving the nature of causality in diversityproductivity relationships.},

  abstract = {In 2011, east Texas experienced the worst drought on record causing extensive tree mortality. Initial mortality estimates for 2012 varied among tree genera. A rapid damage assessment (RDA) estimated that 65.5 ({\AE} 7.3) million trees died as a result of the drought in this region one year post-drought. However, this estimate was untested against established monitoring networks. Moreover, pests and physiological damage can elevate tree mortality multiple years beyond a drought event. Since the RDA was unable to quantify multi-year trends, it remained unclear whether these drivers caused increased tree mortality in east Texas beyond one year post-drought and how different species responded over time. To address these questions, we compared total 2012 standing dead tree (SDT) estimates (i.e., drought-killed plus all other SDT excluding harvested or salvaged trees) derived from the RDA and U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data for east Texas. Total SDT estimates did not significantly differ between the RDA (120.5 {\AE} 8.5 million) and FIA (108.4 {\AE} 8.7 million). Furthermore, total SDT estimates for the four most common genera (Pinus, Quercus, Liquidambar, Ulmus), which comprised over 80\% of all species, did not significantly differ between the RDA and FIA. Additionally, we used logistic regression and FIA data from east Texas for 2011 through four years post-drought (2012\textendash{}2015) to examine temporal trends in plot-level drought- and pest-driven tree mortality of seven key species (Pinus taeda, Pinus echinata, Quercus nigra, Quercus stellata, Quercus falcata, Liquidambar styraciflua, Ulmus alata) from the four most common genera. At the plot-level, drought-driven mortality was immediate for the three Quercus species (notably Q. falcata) and L. styraciflua which significantly increased in 2012 while P. taeda mortality was delayed, not increasing significantly until 2013. Pest-driven mortality increased from 2013 to 2015 for all species, with the highest mortality observed in Q. falcata and lowest in P. taeda and U. alata. This study affirms the validity and value of independent sampling efforts to quantify mortality immediately following major disturbance and also demonstrates the need for longer-term species-level assessments beyond the initial year post-drought to account for differential impacts from drought and pests.},

Here, we assess changes to forest communities at three scales: within-community changes in species composition, individual community spatial shifts and changes across all communities. Location Eastern USA. Major taxa studied Forest tree species. Methods Using a region-wide forest inventory dataset from the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis Program with {$>$} 70,000 plots, we identified forest communities using the latent Dirichlet allocation method. We analysed changes in species composition within communities and assessed community-level spatial shifts over the last three decades to quantify the responses of individual communities to climate change. We used the distribution of forest communities across climate conditions to predict where communities could migrate to during the study period and compared climate-predicted shifts with observed community shifts. Changes across all communities were modelled as a function of climatic and non-climatic variables using generalized linear mixed-effects models. Results We identified 12 regional forest communities of the eastern USA, which varied in their stability of species composition over the study period. All communities experienced relatively short yet significant shifts in their spatial distribution (median = 8.0 km/decade). Historical climate and changes in seasonal temperature variability were the best predictors of change across all communities. However, the distance and direction of individual community migration were poorly predicted by climate change, and the observed direction was often the opposite of the predicted direction. Main conclusions Forest communities shifted their distributions over the last three decades, but climate change outpaced the rate of community migration. Continued lags between climate change and forest community responses and the lack of migration in the direction predicted by climate change might lead to the inability of forests to keep up with changing climate.},

Results A single naturalness-based corridor network represented connectivity for a large ([10) number of focal species as effectively as a group of between 3 and 4 randomly selected focal species. The naturalnessbased approach showed only moderate spatial agreement with composite corridor networks for large numbers of focal species, and better agreed with corridor networks of large-bodied, far-dispersing species in the larger scale analysis.

Yet, results of our literature review, including more than 10,000 articles published in 15 journals from January 2001 and December 2010, indicate that Bayesian approaches are essentially absent from the organizational sciences. Our article introduces organizational science researchers to Bayesian methods and describes why and how they should be used. We use multiple linear regression as the framework to offer a step-by-step demonstration, including the use of software, regarding how to implement Bayesian methods. We explain and illustrate how to determine the prior distribution, compute the posterior distribution, possibly accept the null value, and produce a write-up describing the entire Bayesian process, including graphs, results, and their interpretation. We also offer a summary of the advantages of using Bayesian analysis and examples of how specific published research based on frequentist analysis-based approaches failed to benefit from the advantages offered by a Bayesian approach and how using Bayesian analyses would have led to richer and, in some cases, different substantive conclusions. We hope that our article will serve as a catalyst for the adoption of Bayesian methods in organizational science research.},

  abstract = {Mountain forests are among the most important ecosystems in Europe as they support numerous ecological, hydrological, climatic, social, and economic functions. They are unique relatively natural ecosystems consisting of long-lived species in an otherwise densely populated human landscape. Despite this, centuries of intensive forest management in many of these forests have eclipsed evidence of natural processes, especially the role of disturbances in long-term forest dynamics. Recent trends of land abandonment and establishment of protected forests have coincided with a growing interest in managing forests in more natural states. At the same time, the importance of past disturbances highlighted in an emerging body of literature, and recent increasing disturbances due to climate change are challenging long-held views of dynamics in these ecosystems. Here, we synthesize aspects of this Special Issue on the ecology of mountain forest ecosystems in Europe in the context of broader discussions in the field, to present a new perspective on these ecosystems and their natural disturbance regimes. Most mountain forests in Europe, for which long-term data are available, show a strong and long-term effect of not only human land use but also of natural disturbances that vary by orders of magnitude in size and frequency. Although these disturbances may kill many trees, the forests themselves have not been threatened. The relative importance of natural disturbances, land use, and climate change for ecosystem dynamics varies across space and time. Across the continent, changing climate and land use are altering forest cover, forest structure, tree demography, and natural disturbances, including fires, insect outbreaks, avalanches, and wind disturbances. Projected continued increases in forest area and biomass along with continued warming are likely to further promote forest disturbances. Episodic disturbances may foster ecosystem adaptation to the effects of ongoing and future climatic change. Increasing disturbances, along with trends of less intense land use, will promote further increases in coarse woody debris, with cascading positive effects on biodiversity, edaphic conditions, biogeochemical cycles, and increased heterogeneity across a range of spatial scales. Together, this may translate to disturbance-mediated resilience of forest landscapes and increased biodiversity, as long as climate and disturbance regimes remain within the tolerance of relevant species. Understanding ecological variability, even imperfectly, is integral to anticipating vulnerabilities and promoting ecological resilience, especially under growing uncertainty. Allowing some forests to be shaped by natural processes may be congruent with multiple goals of forest management, even in densely settled and developed countries.},

We conducted a systematic search for relevant studies from selected reference databases, using search terms describing the location, structure and processes, and degree of naturalness of the forest. The studies resulting from these searches were supplemented with other known works that were not indexed in the databases. This procedure yielded a total of 43 studies. The studies were grouped into four types of forest dynamics according to the information presented on the characteristics of the native disturbancesuccession cycle: 1) even-aged stand dynamics driven by stand-replacing disturbances, 2) cohort dynamics driven by partial disturbances, 3) patch dynamics driven by tree mortality at intermediate scales ({$>$}\,200 m2) and 4) gap dynamics driven by tree mortality at fine scales ({$<$}\,200 m2). All four dynamic types were reported from both spruce and pine dominated forests, but their commonness differed. Gap dynamics was most commonly reported in spruce forests, and cohort dynamics in pine forests. The studies reviewed provide the best obtainable overall picture of scientific findings concerning the characteristics and variability of the unmanaged boreal forest dynamics in Fennoscandia. The results demonstrate that the unmanaged Fennoscandian forests are characterized by more diverse and complex dynamics than has traditionally been acknowledged.},

We reviewed the concepts, theories, and strategies related to NDE in boreal forest management. We also reviewed publications that discussed NDE in the boreal forest in general and those that specifically compared NDE-based management with conventional even-aged management. The papers generally focused on northern North America and landscape-scale wildfire as the main disturbance factor, whereas information from Eurasia was exclusively theoretical. Within this limited scope, NDE was generally found to have a positive effect on biodiversity in terms of forest structure and species diversity when compared with conventional even-aged management. Studies on timber supply and social implications of NDE were so few that they preclude generalizations. We conclude that the ecological and economic performance of NDE as a management approach still remains poorly examined. To advance the development of NDE, particular attention should be given to (1) augmenting the knowledge base on natural range of variability of unmanaged forest ecosystems and evaluating the validity of this information in a changing climate, (2) fostering multidisciplinary research with better integration of ecological theory to both integrative and analytical research on NDE, and (3) better integration of socioeconomic concerns, adaptive management schemes, and international collaboration into NDE initiatives.},

  abstract = {Plant species distribution and plant community composition vary along environmental gradients. At the continental scale, climate plays a major role in determining plant distribution, while at the local and regional scales vegetation patterns are more strongly related to edaphic and topographic factors. The projected global warming and alteration of the precipitation regime will influence tree physiology and phenology, and is likely to promote northward migration of tree species. However the influence of soil characteristics on tree species migration is not as well understood. Considering the broad tolerance of most tree species to variations in soil factors, soils should not represent a major constraint for the northward shift of tree species. However, locally or regionally, soil properties may constrain species migration. Thus, while climate change has the potential to induce a northward migration of tree species, local or regional soil properties may hinder their migratory response. These antagonistic forces are likely to slow down potential tree migration in response to climate change. Because tree species respond individualistically to climate variables and soil properties, new tree communities are likely to emerge from climate change. Key words: climate change, tree migration, soil properties, temperate forest, boreal forest.

The objective of this study was to investigate the relative contribution of two other tree-driven mechanisms, litter mixing and forest floor conditions, to foliar litter decomposition and nutrient dynamics for trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) using a microcosm approach. Results based on mixed linear models show that the greater influence over these processes was obtained through litter quality followed by forest floor conditions and litter mixing. Specifically, the results indicate that significantly more C and nutrients were mineralized (i) from aspen than from spruce litter, (ii) from spruce litter in mixture with aspen litter than from spruce litter applied singly, and (iii) from litter incubated on forest floor from the aspen stand rather than from the spruce stand, except for nutrients in the spruce litter. Collectively, our results show that the litter and forest floor material from aspen both favour decomposition and nutrient mineralization processes. Hence, we provide evidence that the effect of tree species on litter decomposition may not only be caused by the properties of its litter but also, indirectly, by the specific conditions and the decomposer community that tree species develop in their forest floor.},

However, whether species interaction networks (e.g., food webs) can also become homogenized remains largely unexplored. Using 48 quantitative parasitoid\textendash{}host networks replicated through space and time across five tropical habitats, we show that deforestation greatly homogenized network structure at a regional level, such that interaction composition became more similar across rice and pasture sites compared with forested habitats. This was not simply caused by altered consumer and resource community composition, but was associated with altered consumer foraging success, such that parasitoids were more likely to locate their hosts in deforested habitats. Furthermore, deforestation indirectly homogenized networks in time through altered mean consumer and prey body size, which decreased in deforested habitats. Similar patterns were obtained with binary networks, suggesting that interaction (link) presence\textendash{}absence data may be sufficient to detect network homogenization effects. Our results show that tropical agroforestry systems can support regionally diverse parasitoid\textendash{}host networks, but that removal of canopy cover greatly homogenizes the structure of these networks in space, and to a lesser degree in time. Spatiotemporal homogenization of interaction networks may alter coevolutionary outcomes and reduce ecological resilience at regional scales, but may not necessarily be predictable from community changes observed within individual trophic levels.},

This framework was mostly limited to quantitative traits without missing values and to situations in which there are more species than traits, although the authors had suggested a way to extend their framework to other trait types. The main purpose of this note is to further develop this suggestion. We describe a highly flexible distance-based framework to measure different facets of FD in multidimensional trait space from any distance or dissimilarity measure, any number of traits, and from different trait types (i.e., quantitative, semi-quantitative, and qualitative). This new approach allows for missing trait values and the weighting of individual traits. We also present a new multidimensional FD index, called functional dispersion (FDis), which is closely related to Rao's quadratic entropy. FDis is the multivariate analogue of the weighted mean absolute deviation (MAD), in which the weights are species relative abundances. For unweighted presence\textendash{}absence data, FDis can be used for a formal statistical test of differences in FD. We provide the ``FD'' R language package to easily implement our distance-based FD framework.},

This analogy has a long history in ecology and has been used to illustrate ecosystem changes over time where the magnitude of changes required to push the ball from one cup to another represents a regime shift to an alternative state. Another approach for visualizing ecosystem stability, resistance, and resilience involves ordinations of repeated measures of community data or environmental variables and tracking trajectories over time in ordination space. Interestingly, the two approaches have not been linked in a meaningful way. Here, we provide a conceptual link between trajectories of ecological change in ordination space to the ball-and-cup analogy and show how distance-based measures calculated from ordination scores can be used to quantitatively classify and evaluate the relative stability and resilience of ecological systems.},

  abstract = {Aim Trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) is absent in the upper foothills region of west-central Alberta because of the cold conditions and short growing season at this high elevation. However, in recent years it appears that aspen has been establishing from seed in this zone and that it has been doing so mainly as a result of forest harvesting. The objectives of this study were to determine the frequency of and types of microsite required for the successful establishment of aspen seedlings at these higher elevations. Location Rocky Mountains Upper Foothills Natural Subregion of west-central Alberta, Canada. Methods The current distribution of mature aspen and the presence and absence of aspen seedlings in harvested areas were determined in an area c. 300 km2 in size, using ground and aerial surveys. In an intensive study, 12 belt transects (180 m long and 5 m wide) were established in areas disturbed by forest harvesting at high elevations where no aspen was present prior to harvesting. Transects were surveyed seven growing seasons after disturbance and the microsites occupied by aspen seedlings were characterized according to their substrate and microtopography. Similarly, the availability of different substrates and microtopographic positions were assessed by systematic point sampling on these sites. Results On level surfaces, aspen seedling regeneration was found up to 200 m higher in elevation than the mature aspen in the original undisturbed forests. Overall, there were 428 seedlings ha-1 established on these transects, and the age distribution indicates that aspen seedlings had established in each of the seven growing seasons since the disturbance. Nearly all of the seedlings (93\%) were established on mineral soil microsites and virtually no seedlings were established on undisturbed forest floor layers. Significantly more seedlings were found in concave microtopographic positions. Main conclusions This study indicates that aspen establishment from seed is currently not a stochastic event and demonstrates that aspen is rapidly expanding its range upslope in the Canadian Rocky Mountain region as a result of forest management practices that expose mineral soil substrates in conjunction with a warming climate. The change in canopy composition from conifer to deciduous forests at these higher elevations will have far-reaching implications for ecosystem processes and functions.},

  abstract = {As climates shift in space, tree species ranges are predicted to shift as well. While range shifts due to climate change have been typically modeled based on abiotic factors alone, interactions among species in diverse communities may alter these range dynamics by inhibiting or enhancing the establishment of propagules along the leading edge, or by increasing or decreasing tolerance to novel climates at the trailing edge. Here, we investigated how the rate of expansion at leading range margins, and contraction at trailing range margins of temperate tree species in response to both past and current climate change related to an important species interaction: whether temperate tree species associate with arbuscular (AM) or ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal symbionts. Mycorrhizal symbioses can mediate plant stress tolerance, and lack of EM fungal mutualists has been linked to establishment failures of EM tree species in new ranges. We found no difference in rates of leading edge expansion between the two guilds. However, EM tree taxa showed reduced contraction at their trailing edge compared to AM taxa in response to both past and current climate change. Since the mycorrhizal guild of the dominant trees may affect ecosystem properties, differential range dynamics between these functional groups of trees may have consequences for the functioning of future forests.},

  abstract = {In the eastern Canadian boreal forest, the term hardwood expansion or encroachment (enfeuillement in French) generally refers to the phenomenon of increasing cover of intolerant hardwoods, notably aspen (Populus tremuloides), following clearcutting. Such expansion is perceived as a local (stand-level) process that is reflected at a larger, regional scale. The objective of this study was to characterize the increase in aspen cover following clearcutting in the clay belt of Abitibi, in northwestern Quebec. Regional data from 3 province-wide forest inventories (1970, 1980, and 1990) conducted by the Quebec Ministry of Natural Resources and Wildlife were analyzed for 2 ecological regions, the Abitibi Plain (western balsam fir\textendash{}white birch bioclimatic subdomain) and the Matagami Lake Plain (western black spruce\textendash{}feathermoss bioclimatic subdomain). An assessment was done of forest cover transformations following clearcutting over 3 decades based on time since harvesting, surface deposit/drainage, and ecological region. Results show that mesic clay sites are particularly susceptible to aspen encroachment and that the overall rate of encroachment from the 1970s to the 1990s in the black spruce and balsam fir regions has been about 30\%. Moreover, despite the greater abundance of poorly drained and organic sites, less favourable to hardwood establishment, in the more northerly black spruce region, the 2 regions appear to present the same sensitivity (or propensity) to intolerant hardwood expansion. On sensitive sites, management of black spruce forests should include adaptive practices to limit increases of the hardwood component.},

In young forests, mortality should be primarily density dependent due to competition for light, leading to an increasingly spatially uniform pattern of surviving trees. In contrast, mortality in old-growth forests should be primarily caused by contagious and spatially autocorrelated agents (e.g., insects, wind), causing spatial aggregation of surviving trees to increase through time. We tested these predictions by contrasting a threedecade record of tree mortality from replicated mapped permanent plots located in young (,60-year-old) and old-growth (.300-year-old) Abies amabilis forests. Trees in young forests died at a rate of 4.42\% per year, whereas trees in old-growth forests died at 0.60\% per year. Tree mortality in young forests was significantly aggregated, strongly density dependent, and caused live tree patterns to become more uniform through time. Mortality in old-growth forests was spatially aggregated, but was density independent and did not change the spatial pattern of surviving trees. These results extend current theory by demonstrating that densitydependent competitive mortality leading to increasingly uniform tree spacing in young forests ultimately transitions late in succession to a more diverse tree mortality regime that maintains spatial heterogeneity through time.},

Therefore, research on the effects of environmental changes on net primary productivity is interesting. In this study we investigated the influence of changing temperature, precipitation and deposition of sulphur and nitrogen compounds on forest growth. The database consisted of 654 plots of the European intensive monitoring program (Level II plots) with 5-year growth data for the period 1994\textendash{}1999. Among these 654 plots only 382 plots in 18 European countries met the requirements necessary to be used in our analysis. Our analysis was done for common beech (Fagus sylvatica), oak (Quercus petraea and Q. robur), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies). We developed an individual tree growth model with measured basal area increment of each individual tree as responding growth factor and tree size (diameter at breast height), tree competition (basal area of larger trees and stand density index), site factors (soil C/N ratio, temperature), and environmental factors (temperature change compared to long-term average, nitrogen and sulphur deposition) as influencing parameters. Using a mixed model approach, all models for the tree species show a high goodness of fit with Pseudo-R2 between 0.33 and 0.44. Diameter at breast height and basal area of larger trees were highly influential variables in all models. Increasing temperature shows a positive effect on growth for all species except Norway spruce. Nitrogen deposition shows a positive impact on growth for all four species. This influence was significant with p {$<$} 0.05 for all species except common beech. For beech the effect was nearly significant (p = 0.077). An increase of 1 kg N ha{\`A}1 yr{\`A}1 corresponds to an increase in basal area increment between 1.20\% and 1.49\% depending on species. Considering an average total carbon uptake for European forests near 1730 kg per hectare and year, this implies an estimated sequestration of approximately 21\textendash{}26 kg carbon per kg nitrogen deposition.},

  abstract = {Summary 1.?Climatic constraints on plant distributions are well known, but predicting community composition through knowledge of trait-based environmental filtering remains an important empirical challenge. Here, we evaluate the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model of trait-based community assembly using forest communities occurring along a 12?\textdegree{}C gradient of mean annual temperature (MAT).We use independent cross-validation to evaluate model predictions from sites where trait constraints are predicted from environmental conditions. We also test whether orthogonal axes of trait variation can be used as predictors to improve model parsimony and explore MaxEnt forecasts of species distributions in a warmer climate. 2.?Environmental factors explained between 31\% and 74\% of the community-weighted mean trait values, indicating moderate-to-strong selection of traits along the environmental gradients. A model with 10 traits explained 54\% of the variation in observed relative abundances, which approached the upper limit of 57\% given the available environmental information. Three orthogonal axes accounted for 81\% of the trait variation among species, and environmental factors explained between 47\% and 67\% of the variation in these axes. However, the axes only explained 18\% of the variation in relative abundances, suggesting that minor axes of functional variation may be important or that models with many traits may achieve good predictive capacity through over-fitting. 3.?Trait?environment relationships formed the basis for predicting vegetation change in a future scenario where MAT was increased by 2.5?\textdegree{}C. The results suggested that up to 78\% of Pinus ponderosa forest in Arizona may transition to dominance by Juniperus monosperma, but this forecast likely overestimates the rates of species migration. 4.?Synthesis.?MaxEnt is a mathematical translation of trait-based environmental filtering of the species pool and performs moderately well in predicting forest community structure using empirical trait?environment relationships. MaxEnt required many traits to achieve good fits, and three orthogonal axes of trait variation performed poorly as predictors of community structure. To be useful predictors, traits must vary strongly among species and community-weighted mean traits must vary predictably along environmental gradients.},

To do so, ecologists are widely using phenomenological models of species distributions that mainly rely on the concept of species niche and generally ignore species' demography, species' adaptive potential, and biotic interactions. This review examines the potential role of the emerging synthetic discipline of evolutionary community ecology in improving our understanding of how climate change will alter future distribution of biodiversity. We review theoretical and empirical advances about the role of niche evolution, interspecific interactions, and their interplay in altering species geographic ranges and community assembly. We discuss potential ways to integrate complex feedbacks between ecology and evolution in ecological forecasting. We also point at a number of caveats in our understanding of the eco-evolutionary consequences of climate change and highlight several challenges for future research.},

Increases in temperature over the last century have clearly been linked to shifts in species distributions. Given the magnitude of projected future climatic changes, we can expect even larger range shifts in the coming century. These changes will, in turn, alter ecological communities and the functioning of ecosystems. Despite the seriousness of predicted climate change, the uncertainty in climate-change projections makes it difficult for conservation managers and planners to proactively respond to climate stresses. To address one aspect of this uncertainty, we identified predictions of faunal change for which a high level of consensus was exhibited by different climate models. Specifically, we assessed the potential effects of 30 coupled atmosphere\textendash{}ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) future-climate simulations on the geographic ranges of 2954 species of birds, mammals, and amphibians in the Western Hemisphere. Eighty percent of the climate projections based on a relatively low greenhouse-gas emissions scenario result in the local loss of at least 10\% of the vertebrate fauna over much of North and South America. The largest changes in fauna are predicted for the tundra, Central America, and the Andes Mountains where, assuming no dispersal constraints, specific areas are likely to experience over 90\% turnover, so that faunal distributions in the future will bear little resemblance to those of today.},

This layer is associated with wet, cool and nutrient-poor soil conditions conducive to the paludification process and pushing the ecosystem towards an unproductive open black spruce forest. The presence of Populus tremuloides in theses stands may halt this process because this species has a high nutrient cycling rate and a litter that represses moss cover. The main hypothesis of this study is that, despite similar abiotic conditions (slope and drainage), the presence of Populus tremuloides in a stand dominated by Picea mariana affects surface soil nutrient availability, total N, pH as well as the decomposition process. The abundance of Populus tremuloides trees was associated with higher exchangeable cations, cationic exchangeable capacity and pH of the forest floor layer on all sites. A decrease in organic matter thickness with increasing aspen presence was also found on all sites, suggesting that this species affects the decomposition process by the quality of its litter as well as by a general improvement of soil physical and chemical properties. The decomposition rate of a standard substrate as well as in vitro potential net nitrogen mineralization were positively related to Populus tremuloides on only one of the three sites, and non-significant on the other sites. Strong immobilization of added nitrogen during incubation was observed on all sites and was not related to aspen, which suggested that in these stands, the soil microbial community is uniformly and strongly nitrogen limited. The zone of influence of Populus tremuloides was evaluated in areas around the soil sampling plot ranging from 3 to 7 m. The results revealed that this zone varies with soil properties. The results suggest that the presence of Populus tremuloides accelerate nutrient cycling, which could affect stand productivity to some extent.},

  abstract = {Robert H. Whittaker defined beta diversity as the variation in species composition among sites in a geographic area. Beta diversity is a key concept for understanding the functioning of ecosystems, for the conservation of biodiversity, and for ecosystem management. This paper explains how hypotheses about the origin of beta diversity can be tested by partitioning the spatial variation of community composition data (presence\textendash{}absence or abundance data) with respect to environmental variables and spatial base functions. We compare two statistical methods to accomplish that. The sum-of-squares of a community composition data table, which is one possible measure of beta diversity, is correctly partitioned by canonical ordination; hence, canonical partitioning produces correct estimates of the different portions of community composition variation. In recent years, several authors interested in the variation in community composition among sites (beta diversity) have used another method, variation partitioning on distance matrices (Mantel approach). Their results led us to compare the two partitioning approaches, using simulated data generated under hypotheses about the variation of community composition among sites. The theoretical developments and simulation results led to the following observations: (1) the variance of a community composition table is a measure of beta diversity. (2) The variance of a dissimilarity matrix among sites is not the variance of the community composition table nor a measure of beta diversity; hence, partitioning on distance matrices should not be used to study the variation in community composition among sites. (3) In all of our simulations, partitioning on distance matrices underestimated the amount of variation in community composition explained by the raw-data approach, and (4) the tests of significance had less power than the tests of canonical ordination. Hence, the proper statistical procedure for partitioning the spatial variation of community composition data among environmental and spatial components, and for testing hypotheses about the origin and maintenance of variation in community composition among sites, is canonical partitioning. The Mantel approach is appropriate for testing other hypotheses, such as the variation in beta diversity among groups of sites. Regression on distance matrices is also appropriate for fitting models to similarity decay plots.},

We addressed the question of which index to use by coding 16 indices using 14 properties that are necessary for beta assessment, comparability among data sets, sampling issues and ordination. Our comparison analysis classified the coefficients under study into five types, three of which are appropriate for beta diversity assessment. Our approach links the concept of beta diversity with the analysis of community data by commonly used methods like ordination and ANOVA. Total beta can be partitioned into Species Contributions (SCBD: degree of variation of individual species across the study area) and Local Contributions (LCBD: comparative indicators of the ecological uniqueness of the sites) to Beta Diversity. Moreover, total beta can be broken up into within- and amonggroup components by MANOVA, into orthogonal axes by ordination, into spatial scales by eigenfunction analysis or among explanatory data sets by variation partitioning.},

  abstract = {Aim The variation in species composition among sites, or beta diversity, can be decomposed into replacement and richness difference. A debate is ongoing in the literature concerning the best ways of computing and interpreting these indices. This paper first reviews the historical development of the formulae for decomposing dissimilarities into replacement, richness difference and nestedness indices. These formulae are presented for species presence\textendash{}absence and abundance using a unified algebraic framework. The indices decomposing beta play different roles in ecological analysis than do beta-diversity indices. Innovation Replacement and richness difference indices can be interpreted and related to ecosystem processes. The pairwise index values can be summed across all pairs of sites; these sums form a valid decomposition of total beta diversity into total replacement and total richness difference components. Different communities and study areas can be compared: some may be dominated by replacement, others by richness/abundance difference processes. Within a region, differences among sites measured by these indices can then be analysed and interpreted using explanatory variables or experimental factors. The paper also shows that local contributions of replacement and richness difference to total beta diversity can be computed and mapped. A case study is presented involving fish communities along a river. Main conclusions The different forms of indices are based upon the same functional numerators. These indices are complementary; they can help researchers understand different aspects of ecosystem functioning. The methods of analysis used in this paper apply to any of the indices recently proposed. Further work, based on ecological theory and numerical simulations, is required to clarify the precise meaning and domain of application of the different forms. The forms available for presence\textendash{}absence and quantitative data are both useful because these different data types allow researchers to answer different types of ecological or biogeographic questions.},

  abstract = {Aim This paper presents the statistical bases for temporal beta-diversity analysis, a method to study changes in community composition through time from repeated surveys at several sites. Surveys of that type are presently done by ecologists around the world. A temporal beta-diversity Index (TBI) is computed for each site, measuring the change in species composition between the first (T1) and second surveys (T2). TBI indices can be decomposed into losses and gains; they can also be tested for significance, allowing one to identify the sites that have changed in composition in exceptional ways. This method will be of value to identify exceptional sites in space\textendash{}time surveys carried out to study anthropogenic impacts, including climate change. Innovation The null hypothesis of the TBI test is that a species assemblage is not exceptionally different between T1 and T2, compared to assemblages that could have been observed at this site at T1 and T2 under conditions corresponding to H0. Tests of significance of coefficients in a dissimilarity matrix are usually not possible because the values in the matrix are interrelated. Here, however, the dissimilarity between T1 and T2 for a site is computed with different data from the dissimilarities used for the T1\textendash{}T2 comparison at other sites. It is thus possible to compute a valid test of significance in that case. In addition, the paper shows how TBI dissimilarities can be decomposed into loss and gain components (of species, or abundances-per-species) and how a B\textendash{}C plot can be produced from these components, which informs users about the processes of biodiversity losses and gains through time in space\textendash{}time survey data. Main conclusion Three applications of the method to different ecological communities are presented. This method is applicable worldwide to all types of communities, marine, and terrestrial. R software is available implementing the method.},

We define temporal stability as the ratio of mean abundance to its standard deviation. Interestingly, the temporal stability of entire communities is predicted to increase fairly linearly, without clear saturation, as diversity increases. Species composition is predicted to be as important as diversity in affecting community stability and productivity. The greater temporal stability of more diverse communities is caused by higher productivity at higher diversity (the ``overyielding'' effect), competitive interactions (the ``covariance'' effect), and statistical averaging (the ``portfolio'' effect). The relative contribution of each cause of temporal stability changes as diversity increases, but the net effect is that greater diversity stabilizes the community even though it destabilizes individual populations. This theory agrees with recent experiments and provides a degree of resolution to the diversitystability debate: both sides of the longstanding debate were correct, but one addressed population stability and the other addressed community stability.},

Its stages include development of an ecologically based model of conservation value, data pre-processing, spatial prioritization analysis, and interpretation of results for conservation action. Here we investigate the details of each stage for analyses done using the Zonation prioritization framework. While there is much literature about analytical methods implemented in Zonation, there is only scattered information available about what happens before and after the computational analysis. Here we fill this information gap by summarizing the pre-analysis and post-analysis stages of the Zonation framework. Concerning the entire process, we summarize the full workflow and list examples of operational best-case, worstcase, and typical scenarios for each analysis stage. We discuss resources needed in different analysis stages. We also discuss benefits, disadvantages, and risks involved in the application of spatial prioritization from the perspective of different stakeholders. Concerning pre-analysis stages, we explain the development of the ecological model and discuss the setting of priority weights and connectivity responses. We also explain practical aspects of data pre-processing and the post-processing interpretation of results for different conservation objectives.

  abstract = {Recent work linking community structure and ecosystem function has primarily focused on the effects of local species richness but has neglected the dispersal-dependent processes of community assembly that are ultimately involved in determining community structure and its relation to ecosystems. Here we combine simple consumer-resource competition models and metacommunity theory with discussion of case studies to outline how spatial processes within metacommunities can alter community assembly and modify expectations about how species diversity and composition influence ecosystem attributes at local scales. We argue that when community assembly is strongly limited by dispersal, this can constrain ecosystem functioning by reducing positive selection effects (reducing the probability of the most productive species becoming dominant) even though it may often also enhance complementarity (favoring combinations of species that enhance production even though they may not individually be most productive). Conversely, excess dispersal with strong source-sink relations among heterogeneous habitats can reduce ecosystem functioning by swamping local filters that would normally favor better-suited species. Ecosystem function is thus most likely maximized at intermediate levels of dispersal where both of these effects are minimized. In this scenario, we find that the selection effect is maximized, while complementarity is often reduced and local diversity may often be relatively low. Our synthesis emphasizes that it is the entire set of community assembly processes that affect the functioning of ecosystems, not just the part that determines local species richness.},

We then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view, that each emphasizes different processes of potential importance in metacommunities. These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone.},

Until now, the field has focused on evaluating the relative importance of distinct processes, with niche-based environmental sorting on one side and neutral-based ecological drift and dispersal limitation on the other. This book moves beyond these artificial categorizations, showing how environmental sorting, dispersal, ecological drift, and other processes influence metacommunity structure simultaneously.  Mathew Leibold and Jonathan Chase argue that the relative importance of these processes depends on the characteristics of the organisms, the strengths and types of their interactions, the degree of habitat heterogeneity, the rates of dispersal, and the scale at which the system is observed. Using this synthetic perspective, they explore metacommunity patterns in time and space, including patterns of coexistence, distribution, and diversity. Leibold and Chase demonstrate how these processes and patterns are altered by micro- and macroevolution, traits and phylogenetic relationships, and food web interactions. They then use this scale-explicit perspective to illustrate how metacommunity processes are essential for understanding macroecological and biogeographical patterns as well as ecosystem-level processes.

However, early detection of recent climate change effects on tree species distribution across the overall temperature gradient remains poorly explored. Within French mountain forests, we investigated altitudinal distribution differences between seedling ({$\leq$}50 cm tall and {$>$}1 yr old) and adult ({$>$}8 m tall) life stages for 17 European tree taxa, encompassing the entire forest elevation range from lowlands to the subalpine vegetation belt (50\textendash{}2250 m a.s.l.) and spanning the latitudinal gradient from northern temperate to southern Mediterranean forests. We simultaneously identified seedlings and adults within the same vegetation plots. These twin observations gave us the equivalent of exactly paired plots in space with seedlings reflecting a response to the studied warm period (1986\textendash{}2006) and adults reflecting a response to a former and cooler period. For 13 out of 17 species, records of the mean altitude of presence at the seedling life stage are higher than that at the adult life stage. The low altitudinal distribution limit of occurrences at the seedling life stage is, on average, 29 m higher than that at the adult life stage which is significant. The high altitudinal distribution limit also shows a similar trend but which is not significant. Complementary analyses using modelling techniques and focusing on the optimum elevation (i.e. the central position inside distribution ranges) have confirmed differences between life stages altitudinal distribution. Seedlings optima are mostly higher than adults optimum, reaching, on average, a 69 m gap. This overall trend showing higher altitudinal distribution at the seedling life stage in comparison to the adult one suggests a main driver of change highly related to elevation, such as climate warming that occurs during the studied period. Other drivers of change that could play an important role across elevation or act at more specific scales are also discussed as potential contributors to explain our results.},

We conducted spatial analyses to evaluate the ability of Canadian protected areas to mitigate the effects of nearby land development. We investigated correlations of national patterns of land development in and around protected areas and then examined national patterns of roads, urban area, and croplands in protected areas. We calculated the amount of developed land in protected areas and within 25\textendash{}100 km of protected-area borders, the density of roads, and extent of urban and cropland area in protected areas. We constructed logistic-regression models to test whether development in a protected area was associated with landscape and protected-area characteristics. Land development was far less extensive inside than outside protected areas. However, several protected areas, particularly small southern areas near small urban centers had substantial development inside their boundaries, and nearly half of protected areas had roads. The cumulative extent of development within 50 km of protected areas was the best predictor of the probability of land development in protected areas. Canadian First Nations, industries, government, and nongovernmental organizations are currently planning an unprecedented number of new protected areas. Careful management of areas beyond protected-area boundaries may prove critical to meeting their long-term conservation objectives.},

The most common methods for predicting the response of biodiversity to changing climate do not explicitly incorporate fundamental evolutionary and ecological processes that determine species responses to changing climate, such as reproduction, dispersal, and adaptation. We provide an overview of an emerging mechanistic spatial theory of species range shifts under climate change. This theoretical framework explicitly defines the ecological processes that contribute to species range shifts via biologically meaningful dispersal, reproductive, and climate envelope parameters. We present methods for estimating the parameters of the model with widely available species occurrence and abundance data and then apply these methods to empirical data for 12 North American butterfly species to illustrate the potential use of the theory for global change biology. The model predicts species persistence in light of current climate change and habitat loss. On average, we estimate that the climate envelopes of our study species are shifting north at a rate of 3.25 6 1.36 km/yr (mean 6 SD) and that our study species produce 3.46 6 1.39 (mean 6 SD) viable offspring per individual per year. Based on our parameter estimates, we are able to predict the relative risk of our 12 study species for lagging behind changing climate. This theoretical framework improves predictions of global change outcomes by facilitating the development and testing of hypotheses, providing mechanistic predictions of current and future range dynamics, and encouraging the adaptive integration of theory and data. The theory is ripe for future developments such as the incorporation of biotic interactions and evolution of adaptations to novel climatic conditions, and it has the potential to be a catalyst for the development of more effective conservation strategies to mitigate losses of biodiversity from global climate change.},

  abstract = {We introduce minimum dynamic reserves: a framework for the minimum reserve size required to incorporate natural disturbance and maintain ecological processes. The minimum dynamic reserve framework is a refinement of the minimum dynamic area concept, relating the size of the dominant disturbance on a landscape to communities of species that may be differentially affected by this disturbance. We present criteria for estimating the size, location, and efficacy of a minimum dynamic reserve and then apply our approach to identify a candidate minimum dynamic reserve in the Mackenzie Valley region of Canada. In this region, forest fire is the major natural disturbance that influences vegetation community dynamics and dependent fauna. The size and location of a minimum dynamic reserve is determined by the estimated maximum extent of the largest disturbance event and the extent and distribution of communities of species that are differentially affected by disturbance. A minimum dynamic reserve is deemed effective if it maintains internal recolonization sources through time. We designed and evaluated our candidate minimum dynamic reserve using a spatially explicit, dynamic simulation model, CONSERV, that incorporates locally calibrated fire and vegetation dynamics. During simulations, our candidate minimum dynamic reserve maintained its recolonization sources through time, suggesting that minimum dynamic reserves may provide an operational framework for determining reserve size in dynamic landscapes under the influence of large natural disturbances such as fire, insect outbreaks, windstorms and flooding.},

This fundamental ecosystem attribute has long been recognized but the influence of this property on community regulation has not been investigated. We propose that this environmental attribute may explain variation in the strength of trophic cascades among ecosystems. Simply because of gravity, we should predict that systems with convex profiles receive low amounts of subsidies whereas systems with concave profiles act as spatial attractors, and receive high amounts of subsidies. The subsidy hypothesis states that ecosystems with high amounts of allochthonous inputs will experience the strongest trophic cascades. To test this hypothesis, we derive ecosystem models and investigate the effect of location and magnitude of subsidies on the strength of trophic cascades. Predictions from our models support the subsidy hypothesis and highlight the need to consider ecosystems as open to allochthonous flows.},

Despite increasing prominence and shared goals, their compatibility and complementarity have received little attention. This paucity of overlap not only presents an obstacle to newcomers to the field, but it also precludes further conceptual advances at their interface. Here, we present a synthetic treatment of the two frameworks. We review their main concepts and explore their theoretical and empirical relationship, focusing on how the resource supply ratio, impact niche, and requirement niche of contemporary niche theory translate into the stabilizing and equalizing processes of modern coexistence theory. We show, for a general consumer\textendash{}resource model, that varying resource supply ratios reflects an equalizing process; varying impact niche overlap reflects a stabilizing process; and varying requirement niche overlap may be both stabilizing and equalizing, but has no qualitative effect on coexistence. These generalizations provide mechanistic insight into modern coexistence theory, while also clarifying the role of contemporary niche theory's impacts and requirements in mediating coexistence. From an empirical perspective, we recommend a hierarchical approach, in which quantification of the strength of stabilizing mechanisms is used to guide more focused investigation into the underlying niche factors determining species coexistence. Future research that considers alternative assumptions, including different forms of species interaction, spatiotemporal heterogeneity, and priority effects, would facilitate a more complete synthesis of the two frameworks.},

We incorporate soil feedbacks into annual plant invasion models, derive the conditions under which such feedbacks affect spread, and support our approach with simulations. We show that in homogeneous landscapes, strong positive feedbacks can influence spreading velocity for annual invaders, but that empirically documented feedbacks are not strong enough to do so. Moreover, to influence spread, invaders must modify the soil environment over a spatial scale larger than is biologically realistic. Though unimportant for annual invader spread in our models, feedbacks do affect invader density and potential impact. We discuss how future research might consider the way landscape structure, dispersal patterns, and the time scales over which plant\textendash{}soil feedbacks develop regulate the effects of such feedbacks on invader spread.},

Researchers must also identify the most relevant scales and variables to be considered, the required data resources, and the appropriate study design to provide the proper inferences. The large volumes of multi-thematic data often associated with macrosystem studies typically require validation, standardization, and assimilation. Finally, analytical approaches need to describe how cross-scale and hierarchical dynamics and interactions relate to macroscale phenomena.

Using point counts of bird abundance in 2007 and 2008, we show that changes in vegetation driven by elevation are strongly correlated with avian community structure in this treeline ecotone system. Overall, avian diversity was higher in the forest compared with other habitat classes (krummholz, deciduous shrub, and alpine). There were strong correlations between avian diversity and vegetation richness, as well as structure, among and within habitat class in 2008. Numerous habitat types (subset of habitat class) were correlated with avian composition, although some species were clearly habitat generalists. Contrary to expectation, avian species composition was associated with physiognomy (vegetation structure) in alpine and deciduous shrub, and with either physiognomy or floristics (vegetation species composition) in krummholz and forest. Given the strong impact of elevation on vegetation and the demonstrated influence on bird communities, we note that for bird species whose near-southernmost populations are found in the Mealy Mountains, climate change is likely to have a strong negative effect if alpine tundra habitat is lost. Furthermore, forest bird species are likely to benefit from the increased tree cover as treeline moves poleward and upward.},

  abstract = {Climate change is expected to cause geographic shifts in tree species' ranges, but such shifts may not keep pace with climate changes because seed dispersal distances are often limited and competition-induced changes in community composition can be relatively slow. Disturbances may speed changes in community composition, but the interactions among climate change, disturbance and competitive interactions to produce range shifts are poorly understood. We used a physiologically based mechanistic landscape model to study these interactions in the northeastern United States. We designed a series of disturbance scenarios to represent varied disturbance regimes in terms of both disturbance extent and intensity. We simulated forest succession by incorporating climate change under a high-emissions future, disturbances, seed dispersal, and competition using the landscape model parameterized with forest inventory data. Tree species range boundary shifts in the next century were quantified as the change in the location of the 5th (the trailing edge) and 95th (the leading edge) percentiles of the spatial distribution of simulated species. Simulated tree species range boundary shifts in New England over the next century were far below (usually {$<$}20 km) that required to track the velocity of temperature change (usually more than 110 km over 100 years) under a high-emissions scenario. Simulated species` ranges shifted northward at both the leading edge (northern boundary) and trailing edge (southern boundary). Disturbances may expedite species' recruitment into new sites, but they had little effect on the velocity of simulated range boundary shifts. Range shifts at the trailing edge tended to be associated with photosynthetic capacity, competitive ability for light and seed dispersal ability, whereas shifts at the leading edge were associated only with photosynthetic capacity and competition for light. This study underscores the importance of understanding the role of interspecific competition and disturbance when studying tree range shifts.},

Forest inventory datasets offer unprecedented opportunities to model these dynamics, but they are analytically challenging due to high dimensionality and sampling irregularities across years. We develop a data-intensive methodology for predicting forest stand dynamics using such datasets. Our methodology involves the following steps: 1) computing stand level characteristics from individual tree measurements, 2) reducing the characteristic dimensionality through analyses of their correlations, 3) parameterizing transition matrices for each uncorrelated dimension using Gibbs sampling, and 4) deriving predictions of forest developments at different timescales. Applying our methodology to a forest inventory database from Quebec, Canada, we discovered that four uncorrelated dimensions were required to describe the stand structure: the biomass, biodiversity, shade tolerance index and stand age. We were able to successfully estimate transition matrices for each of these dimensions. The model predicted substantial short-term increases in biomass and longer-term increases in the average age of trees, biodiversity, and shade intolerant species. Using highly dimensional and irregularly sampled forest inventory data, our original data-intensive methodology provides both descriptions of the short-term dynamics as well as predictions of forest development on a longer timescale. This method can be applied in other contexts such as conservation and silviculture, and can be delivered as an efficient tool for sustainable forest management.},

  abstract = {Many indicators and criteria have been proposed to assess the sustainable management of forests but their scientific validity remains uncertain. Because the effects of forest disturbances (such as logging) are often specific to particular species, sites, landscapes, regions and forest types, management ``shortcuts'' such as indicator species, focal species and threshold levels of vegetation cover may be of limited generic value. We propose an alternative approach based on a set of five guiding principles for biodiversity conservation that are broadly applicable to any forested area: (1) the maintenance of connectivity; (2) the maintenance of landscape heterogeneity; (3) the maintenance of stand structural complexity; and (4) the maintenance of aquatic ecosystem integrity; (5) the use of natural disturbance regimes to guide human disturbance regimes. We present a checklist of measures for forest biodiversity conservation that reflects the multi-scaled nature of conservation approaches on forested land. At the regional scale, management should ensure the establishment of large ecological reserves. At the landscape scale, off-reserve conservation measures should include: (1) protected areas within production forests; (2) buffers for aquatic ecosystems; (3) appropriately designed and located road networks; (4) the careful spatial and temporal arrangement of harvest units; and (5) appropriate fire management practices. At the stand level, off-reserve conservation measures should include: (1) the retention of key elements of stand structural complexity (e.g., large living and dead trees with hollows, understorey thickets, and large fallen logs); (2) long rotation times (coupled with structural retention at harvest); (3) silvicultural systems alternative to traditional high impact ones (e.g., clearcutting in some forest types); and (4) appropriate fire management practices and practices for the management of other kinds of disturbances. Although the general ecological principles and associated checklist are intuitive, data to evaluate the effectiveness of many specific on-the-ground management actions are limited. Considerable effort is needed to adopt adaptive management ``natural experiments'' and monitoring to: (1) better identify the impacts of logging operations and other kinds of management activities on biodiversity, and; (2) quantify the effectiveness of impact mitigation strategies; and (3) identify ways to improve management practices.},

The most important potential impacts of climate change on forest goods and services are summarized for the Boreal, Temperate Oceanic, Temperate Continental, Mediterranean, and mountainous regions. Especially in northern and western Europe the increasing atmospheric CO2 content and warmer temperatures are expected to result in positive effects on forest growth and wood production, at least in the short\textendash{}medium term. On the other hand, increasing drought and disturbance risks will cause adverse effects. These negative impacts are very likely to outweigh positive trends in southern and eastern Europe. From west to east, the drought risk increases. In the Mediterranean regions productivity is expected to decline due to strongly increased droughts and fire risks.},

Using Bayesian analysis of over 430,000 tree records from a large eastern US forest database we characterised tree mortality as a function of climate, soils, species and size (stem diameter). We found (1) mortality is U-shaped vs. stem diameter for all 21 species examined; (2) mortality is hump-shaped vs. plot basal area for most species; (3) geographical variation in mortality is substantial, and correlated with several environmental factors; and (4) individual species vary substantially from the combined average in the nature and magnitude of their mortality responses to environmental variation. Regional variation in mortality is therefore the product of variation in species composition combined with highly varied mortalityenvironment correlations within species. The results imply that variation in mortality is a crucial part of variation in the forest carbon cycle, such that including this variation in models of the global carbon cycle could significantly narrow uncertainty in climate change predictions.},

Most species distribution modelling techniques produce continuous suitability predictions, but many real applications (e.g. reserve design, species invasion and climate change impact assessment) and model evaluations require binary outputs, and thresholds are needed for these transformations. Although there are many threshold selection methods for presence/absence data, it is unclear whether these are suitable for presence-only data. In this paper, we investigate mathematically and empirically which of the existing threshold selection methods can be used confidently with presence-only data.},

  pages = {1632--1645},
  abstract = {Past simulation studies using a variety of models have generally agreed that climatic warming could have adverse effects on forests, including large-scale diebacks in some regions and drastic range shrinkages of many species. These effects should be most evident at biome transition zones. Other studies have pointed out, however, that past models have used a parabolic temperature response function that is based on geographic range limits rather than functional responses or data and that this parabolic model could exaggerate dieback effects. A new model is proposed for growing degree-days temperature response, which is asymptotic rather than parabolic. In this new model, tree height growth rate increases and then levels off with increasing growing degree-days. Species from more southern regions have a higher asymptote. It is shown that this model can be derived from the integration of a parabolic growth response to temperature over a year-long sinusoidal temperature regime. The SORTIE forest simulation model was modified to incorporate this response function. An ecotonal region was simulated under a warming scenario. The traditional parabolic temperature response model produced a wide zone of dieback following warming. In contrast, the new asymptotic response function produced no dieback and a stable ecotone that migrated north at {$<$}100 m/100 years.},

The basic hypotheses and assumptions behind the formalism are formulated and discussed from the viewpoint of the prognostic potential in the resulting models. Fundamental mathematical results from the theory of stochastic processes guarantee the existence of a stationary probability distribution of states in any finite, regular, time-homogeneous Markov chain, and any initial distribution of chain states does converge to some stationary distribution, matching the paradigm of classical succession theory. We propose a general method for estimation of time-homogeneous transition probabilities applicable for any kind of successional scheme, yet with strong requirements to the expert data: average duration times should be known for each specified stage of succession as well as the likelihood proportions among the transitions from the ramifying states of the scheme. Constructed by this method on a single set of data, the discrete- and continuous-time models are proved to converge to the identical distributions, while the average sojourn times in each state are shown to be also the same in the two models. Succession through forest types in a mixed (coniferous\textendash{}deciduous) forest in Central Russia is considered as an example.},

Here, we review empirical approaches to metacommunities, both observational and experimental, pertaining to how well they relate to and test theoretical metacommunity paradigms and how well they capture the realities of natural ecosystems. First, we show that the species-sorting and mass-effects paradigms are the most commonly tested and supported paradigms. Second, the dynamics observed can often be ascribed to two or more of the four non-exclusive paradigms. Third, empirical approaches relate only weakly to the concise assumptions and predictions made by the paradigms. Consequently, we suggest major avenues of improvement for empirical metacommunity approaches, including the integration across theoretical approaches and the incorporation of evolutionary and meta-ecosystem dynamics. We hope for metacommunity ecology to thereby bridge existing gaps between empirical and theoretical work, thus becoming a more powerful framework to understand dynamics across ecosystems.},

  abstract = {It is widely accepted that for many North American forest ecosystems, changes in species composition and structure are associated with departures from natural disturbance regimes (e.g., fire exclusion). It also widely accepted that restoration of species composition and structure, similar to those which existed under natural disturbance regimes, will in turn restore and maintain: (1) ecosystem resilience to a broad range of environmental challenges; (2) important elements of ecosystem function; and (3) disturbance-adapted species assemblages and thus conservation of biodiversity. Much of the research relevant to emulating natural disturbance regimes (ENDR) in North America has focused on natural fire regimes, particularly those characterized by frequent/low-severity fires. Increasingly, attention is being focused on natural disturbance regimes other than fire and on interactions between different disturbance types. However, the greatest challenges to implementation of ENDR are socioeconomic rather than ecological. There is, for example, limited social acceptance of management based on highseverity natural disturbance regimes. And while there is much broader acceptance of ENDR based on frequent/low-severity disturbance regimes, there is nevertheless strong disagreement concerning how ENDR is to be implemented.},

Understanding the consequences of these flows should be a basic goal of ecosystem science, and yet it has received scant theoretical treatment to date. Here, using a simple, open, nutrient-limited ecosystem model with trophic interactions, we explore theoretically how spatial flows affect the functioning of local ecosystems, how physical mass-balance constraints interact with biological demographic constraints in the regulation of this functioning, and how failure to consider these constraints explicitly can lead to models that are ecologically inconsistent. In particular, we show that standard prey-dependent models for trophic interactions may lead to implausible outcomes when embedded in an ecosystem context with appropriate mass flows and mass-balance constraints. Our analysis emphasizes the need for integration of population, community, and ecosystem perspectives in ecology and the critical consequences of assuming closed versus open systems.},

  abstract = {Climate change can impair ecosystem functions and services in extensive dry forests worldwide. However, attribution of climate change impacts on tree growth and forest productivity is challenging due to multiple inter-annual patterns of climatic variability associated with atmospheric and oceanic circulations. Moreover, growth responses to rising atmospheric CO2, namely carbon fertilization, as well as size ontogenetic changes can obscure the climate change signature as well. Here we apply Structural Equation Models (SEM) to investigate the relative role of climate change on tree growth in an extreme Mediterranean environment (i.e., extreme in terms of the combination of sandy-unconsolidated soils and climatic aridity). Specifically, we analyzed potential direct and indirect pathways by which different sources of climatic variability (i.e. warming and precipitation trends, the North Atlantic Oscillation, [NAO]; the Mediterranean Oscillation, [MOI]; the Atlantic Mediterranean Oscillation, [AMO]) affect aridity through their control on local climate (in terms of mean annual temperature and total annual precipitation), and subsequently tree productivity, in terms of basal area increments (BAI). Our results support the predominant role of Diameter at Breast Height (DHB) as the main growth driver. In terms of climate, NAO and AMO are the most important drivers of tree growth through their control of aridity (via effects of precipitation and temperature, respectively). Furthermore and contrary to current expectations, our findings also support a net positive role of climate warming on growth over the last 50 years and suggest that impacts of climate warming should be evaluated considering multi-annual and multi-decadal periods of local climate defined by atmospheric and oceanic circulation in the North Atlantic.},

Simulation exercises were carried out to test the following (not mutually exclusive) hypotheses in relation to forest compositional variations observed within the study area today: (1) disturbance-mediated succession can accelerate the conversion of early successional forest communities dominated by pioneer tree species (e.g. Douglas fir) to later successional associations; (2) when present in the canopy, long-lived, tall, pioneer species such as Douglas fir strongly influence stand dynamics, regardless of the type of canopy disturbance; (3) silvicultural practices that emulate the autogenic natural disturbance regime of small canopy gaps will maintain a late-successional character at the stand level. Model simulations of forest successional dynamics suggested that: (1) repeated, small-scale disturbances such as light windstorms or small patch harvesting can accelerate the rate of tree species replacement by accelerating forest succession; (2) large-scale disturbances such as infrequent severe fires set back succession to an earlier seral stage dominated by Douglas fir; (3) clear-cutting without Douglas fir planting accelerates forest succession towards a western hemlock/western redcedar forest; (4) on mesic sites in the CWHdm subzone, Douglas fir will not dominate stand dynamics, unless there are infrequent, severe fire disturbances; (5) the creation of small openings through partial harvesting did not allow shade intolerant species to re-establish naturally and dominate the forest stand dynamics. It was concluded that modelled successional dynamics and composition of these forests are largely a function of the initial competitive interactions and the relative shade tolerance of species involved.},

  abstract = {Many species are expanding at their leading-edge range boundaries in response to climate warming. Species are known to respond individualistically to climate change, but there has been little consideration of whether responses are consistent over time. We compared responses of 37 southerly distributed British butterflies over two study periods, first between 1970\textendash{}1982 and 1995\textendash{}1999 and then between 1995\textendash{}1999 and 2005\textendash{}2009, when mean annual temperature increased regionally by 0.03 \textdegree{}C yr{\`A}1 (a significant rate of increase) and 0.01 \textdegree{}C yr{\`A}1(a nonsignificant increase) respectively. Our study species might be expected to benefit from climate warming. We measured three responses to climate to investigate this; changes in range margin, distribution area and abundance. In general, the responses of species were inconsistent over time. Species that increased their distribution areas during the first period tended to do so again during the second period, but the relationship was weak. Changes in range margins and abundance were not consistent. In addition, only 5/37 species showed qualitatively similar responses in all three response variables over time (three species increased and two species declined in all variables in both periods). Overall rates of range expansion and distribution area change were significantly greater in the second study period, despite the lower rate of warming, perhaps due to species exploiting climate-distribution lags remaining from the earlier, warmer period. However, there was a significantly greater decline in abundance during the second study period, so range expansions northwards were not necessarily accompanied by increases in distribution area and/or abundance. Hence, species ranges have been thinning as they have expanded northwards. The idiosyncratic responses of these species likely reflect the balance of climatic and habitat drivers of species distribution and abundance changes.},

  abstract = {Aim Greenhouse-induced warming and resulting shifts in climatic zones may exceed the migration capabilities of some species. We used fourteen combinations of General Circulation Models (GCMs) and Global Vegetation Models (GVMs) to investigate possible migration rates required under CO2-doubled climatic forcing. Location Global. Methods Migration distances were calculated between grid cells of future biome type x and nearest same-biome-type cells in the current climate. In `base-case' calculations, we assumed that 2 \texttimes{} CO2 climate forcing would occur in 100 years, we used ten biome types and we measured migration distances as straight-line distances ignoring water barriers and human development. In sensitivity analyses, we investigated different time periods of 2 \texttimes{} CO2 climate forcing, more narrowly defined biomes and barriers because of water bodies and human development. Results In the base-case calculations, average migration rates varied significantly according to the GVM used (BIOME3 vs. MAPSS), the age of the GCM (older- vs. newer-generation GCMs), and whether or not GCMs included sulphate cooling or CO2 fertilization effects. However, high migration rates ({$\geq$} 1000 m year-1) were relatively common in all models, consisting on average of 17\% grid cells for BIOME3 and 21\% for MAPSS. Migration rates were much higher in boreal and temperate biomes than in tropical biomes. Doubling of the time period of 2 \texttimes{} CO2 forcing reduced these areas of high migration rates to c. 12\% of grid cells for both BIOME3 and MAPSS. However, to obtain migration rates in the Boreal biome that were similar in magnitude to those observed for spruce when it followed the retreating North American Glacier, a radical increase in the period of warming was required, from 100 to {$>$}1000 years. A reduction in biome area by an order of magnitude increased migration rates by one to three orders of magnitude, depending on the GVM. Large water bodies and human development had regionally important effects in increasing migration rates. Main conclusions In conclusion, evidence from coupled GCMs and GVMs suggests that global warming may require migration rates much faster than those observed during post-glacial times and hence has the potential to reduce biodiversity by selecting for highly mobile and opportunistic species. Several poorly understood factors that are expected to influence the magnitude of any such reduction are discussed, including intrinsic migrational capabilities, barriers to migration, the role of outlier populations in increasing migration rates, the role of climate in setting range limits and variation in species range sizes.},

  abstract = {Ongoing climate change is expected to shift tree species distribution and therefore affect forest biodiversity and ecosystem services. To assess and project tree distributional shifts, researchers may compare the distribution of juvenile and adult trees under the assumption that differences between tree life stages reflect distributional shifts triggered by climate change. However, the distribution of tree life stages could differ within the lifespan of trees, therefore, we hypothesize that currently observed distributional differences could represent shifts over ontogeny as opposed to climatically driven changes. Here, we test this hypothesis with data from 1435 plots resurveyed after more than three decades across the Western Carpathians. We compared seedling, sapling and adult distribution of 12 tree species along elevation, temperature and precipitation gradients. We analyzed (i) temporal shifts between the surveys and (ii) distributional differences between tree life stages within both surveys. Despite climate warming, tree species distribution of any life stage did not shift directionally upward along elevation between the surveys. Temporal elevational shifts were species specific and an order of magnitude lower than differences among tree life stages within the surveys. Our results show that the observed range shifts among tree life stages are more consistent with ontogenetic differences in the species' environmental requirements than with responses to recent climate change. The distribution of seedlings substantially differed from saplings and adults, while the distribution of saplings did not differ from adults, indicating a critical transition between seedling and sapling tree life stages. Future research has to take ontogenetic differences among life stages into account as we found that distributional differences recently observed worldwide may not reflect climate change but rather the different environmental requirements of tree life stages.},

These two stressors are likely to interact, but how climate change will mediate the effects of land-cover change remains poorly understood. Here we use an empirically-derived model of the interaction between habitat loss and climate to predict the implications of this for biodiversity loss and conservation priorities at a global scale. Risk analysis was used to estimate the risk of biodiversity loss due to alternative future land-cover change scenarios and to quantify how climate change mediates this risk. We demonstrate that the interaction of climate change with land-cover change could increase the impact of land-cover change on birds and mammals by up to 43\% and 24\% respectively and alter the spatial distribution of threats. Additionally, we show that the ranking of global biodiversity hotspots by threat depends critically on the interaction between climate change and habitat loss. Our study suggests that the investment of conservation resources will likely change once the interaction between climate change and land-cover change is taken into account. We argue that global conservation efforts must take this into account if we are to develop cost-effective conservation policies and strategies under global change.},

  abstract = {Climate change and habitat loss are both key threatening processes driving the global loss in biodiversity. Yet little is known about their synergistic effects on biological populations due to the complexity underlying both processes. If the combined effects of habitat loss and climate change are greater than the effects of each threat individually, current conservation management strategies may be inefficient and at worst ineffective. Therefore, there is a pressing need to identify whether interacting effects between climate change and habitat loss exist and, if so, quantify the magnitude of their impact. In this article, we present a meta-analysis of studies that quantify the effect of habitat loss on biological populations and examine whether the magnitude of these effects depends on current climatic conditions and historical rates of climate change. We examined 1319 papers on habitat loss and fragmentation, identified from the past 20 years, representing a range of taxa, landscapes, land-uses, geographic locations and climatic conditions. We find that current climate and climate change are important factors determining the negative effects of habitat loss on species density and/or diversity. The most important determinant of habitat loss and fragmentation effects, averaged across species and geographic regions, was current maximum temperature, with mean precipitation change over the last 100 years of secondary importance. Habitat loss and fragmentation effects were greatest in areas with high maximum temperatures. Conversely, they were lowest in areas where average rainfall has increased over time. To our knowledge, this is the first study to conduct a global terrestrial analysis of existing data to quantify and test for interacting effects between current climate, climatic change and habitat loss on biological populations. Understanding the synergistic effects between climate change and other threatening processes has critical implications for our ability to support and incorporate climate change adaptation measures into policy development and management response.},

We studied a meta-ecosystem model where two autotroph\textendash{}consumer communities are spatially coupled through the diffusion of the limiting nutrient. We analyzed regional and local stability, as well as spatial and temporal synchrony to elucidate the impacts of nutrient recycling and diffusion on trophic dynamics. We show that nutrient diffusion is capable of inducing asynchronous local destabilization of biotic compartments through a diffusion-induced spatiotemporal bifurcation. Nutrient recycling interacts with nutrient diffusion and influences the susceptibility of the meta-ecosystem to diffusion-induced instabilities. This interaction between nutrient recycling and transport is further shown to depend on ecosystem enrichment. It more generally emphasizes the importance of meta-ecosystem theory for predicting species persistence and distribution in managed ecosystems.},

However, these processes have been tackled separately by {\^O}food web metacommunity{\~O} ecology, which focuses on the movement of traits, and {\^O}landscape ecosystem{\~O} ecology, which focuses on the movement of materials among ecosystems. Here, we argue that this conceptual gap must be bridged to fully understand ecosystem dynamics because many natural cases demonstrate the existence of interactions between the movements of traits and materials. This unification of concepts can be achieved under the metaecosystem framework, and we present two models that highlight how this framework yields novel insights. We then discuss patches, limiting factors and spatial explicitness as key issues to advance metaecosystem theory.

  abstract = {The composition and health of forests across western North America have shown signs of change over the last half-century associated with altered climate conditions. Most models developed to predict responses to variation in climate assume that the ecological distribution of adult trees provides a sound basis for projecting potential shifts in a species' range. Under a dynamic climate, however, recently established seedlings may more closely reflect changes in climate conditions. This study combined the simple, widely tested physiological model 3-PG with an empirical regeneration dataset, composed of 21,097 plots, to assess regional scale changes in tree species distributions across British Columbia, Canada. We geographically registered all plot locations to correspond with topographically-adjusted 1 km monthly climatic data for the period 2000\textendash{}2009. By comparing the distribution of seedlings to that of mature trees present in an earlier period (1950\textendash{}1975), we could assess where alterations in the environment have occurred, and the extent to which changes may make a species vulnerable to replacement in some places or likely to regenerate and migrate elsewhere. Decision tree models were developed to assess the relative importance of suboptimal temperatures, frost, soil water deficits and evaporative demand on the growth and distribution of four widely distributed species: Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), western larch (Larix occidentalis), and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa). Tree responses varied by species, with areas suitable for lodgepole pine experiencing the largest relative increase in summer drought and areas dominated by western larch experiencing the least. Those areas modelled as suitable for species range expansions occurred 79\% (SD = 16\%) of the time in places where seedlings of a designated species were predicted in 2000\textendash{}2009 using the regeneration dataset. We conclude that employing seedling surveys in concert with tree surveys provide valuable ecological insights when predicting species responses to climate shifts.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) to evaluate trees' potential responses to climate change are essential for developing appropriate forest management strategies. However, there is a great need to better understand these models' limitations and evaluate their uncertainties. We have previously developed statistical models of suitable habitat, based on both species' range and abundance, to better understand potential changes of 134 tree species habitats in the eastern United States (http://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/ atlas). Our focus here is to build on these results via a more robust assessment framework called modification factors (ModFacs) that is made up of five components. ModFac 1 addresses nine biological characteristics (e.g., shade tolerance and seedling establishment) that quantify the influence of species life-history traits. ModFac 2 considers 12 disturbance characteristics (e.g., insect pests, drought, and fire topkill) which address the capacity of a species to tolerate and respond to climate-induced changes in habitat. ModFac 3\textendash{}5 distill the tree SDM results and facilitate communication of model uncertainty; we quantified the variability in projected change for General Circulation Models (GCM) and emissions scenarios (ModFac 3), the extent to which each species' habitat intersects novel climate conditions (ModFac4), and accounted for long-distance extrapolations beyond a species' current range (ModFac5). The life-history components of ModFacs 1 and 2 demonstrate the marked variability among species in terms of biological and disturbance characteristics, suggesting diverse abilities to adapt to climate change. ModFacs 3\textendash{}5 show that the information from the SDMs can be enhanced by quantifying the variability associated with specific GCM/emission scenarios, the emergence of novel climates for particular tree species, and the distances of species habitat shifts with climate change. The ModFacs framework has high interpretive value when considered in conjunction with the outputs of species habitat models for this century. Importantly, the intention of this assessment was not to create a static scoring system, but to broadly assess species characteristics that likely will play an important role in adaptation to climate change. We believe these scores based on biological, disturbance, and model synthesis factors provide an important expansion of interpretive and practical value to habitat model projections.},

In North America, knowledge about TreMs is still lacking but defect surveys are largely available in managed forests. The objectives of our study were: (1) to demonstrate that defect surveys can be a reliable resource to identify TreMs; and, (2) to evaluate the capacity of silvicultural treatments to maintain TreM abundance and diversity according to a harvest gradient. To achieve these objectives, we identified TreMs from a defect survey performed the year a harvest gradient was applied to 20 plots, including uncut control, shelterwood treatments removing 50\%, 43\% and 36\% of basal area, and clearcut (4 plots/treatment). The density and composition of TreMs were then compared based on treatments. Overall, 38\% of defects actually corresponded to TreMs, confirming that tree-defects can be used as TreM proxies. Bark loss was the most abundant TreM. While there was practically no TreM in clearcuts, all shelterwood treatments initially maintained TreM diversity and density at the same values found in uncut control plots. Shelterwood systems, especially those maintaining a continuous cover, could therefore prove helpful to sustain TreMs and their biodiversity in managed forests.},

The intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE)\textemdash{}an index of CO2 fixed per unit of potential water lost via transpiration\textemdash{}of nine dominant species was determined in replicated transects along an {$\sim$}1,500-m elevation gradient, spanning a broad range of climatic conditions and soils derived from three different parent materials. Stable isotope ratios of carbon and oxygen measured at the leaf level were combined with field-based and remotely sensed metrics of stand productivity, revealing that variation in iWUE depends primarily on leaf traits ({$\sim$}24\% of the variability), followed by stand productivity ({$\sim$}16\% of the variability), climatic regime ({$\sim$}13\% of the variability), and soil development ({$\sim$}12\% of the variability). Significant interactions between species composition and soil properties proved useful to predict changes in forest carbon\textendash{}water relations. On the basis of observed shifts in tree species composition, ongoing since the 1950s and intensified in recent years, an increase in water loss through transpiration (ranging from 10 to 60\% depending on parent material) is now expected in mixed conifer forests throughout the region.},

  abstract = {In the conservation literature on land-use change, it is often assumed that land-use intensification drives species loss, driving a loss of functional trait diversity and ecosystem function. Modern research, however, does not support this cascade of loss for all natural systems. In this paper we explore the errors in this assumption and present a conceptual model taking a more mechanistic approach to the species\textendash{}functional trait association in a context of land-use change. We provide empirical support for our model's predictions demonstrating that the association of species and functional trait diversity follows various trajectories in response to land-use change. The central premise of our model is that land-use change impacts upon processes of community assembly, not species per se. From the model, it is clear that community context (i.e. type of disturbance, species pool size) will affect the response trajectory of the relationship between species and functional trait diversity in communities undergoing land-use change. The maintenance of ecosystem function and of species diversity in the face of increasing land-use change are complementary goals. The use of a more ecologically realistic model of responses of species and functional traits will improve our ability to make wise management decisions to achieve both aims in specific at-risk systems.},

  abstract = {Climate and land use changes are major threats to biodiversity. To preserve biodiversity, networks of protected areas have been established worldwide, like the Natura 2000 network across the European Union (EU). Currently, this reserve network consists of more than 26000 sites covering more than 17\% of EU terrestrial territory. Its efficiency to mitigate the detrimental effects of land use and climate change remains an open research question. Here, we examined the potential current and future geographical ranges of four birds of prey under scenarios of both land use and climate changes. By using graph theory, we examined how the current Natura 2000 network will perform in regard to the conservation of these species. This approach determines the importance of a site in regard to the total network and its connectivity. We found that sites becoming unsuitable due to climate change are not a random sample of the network, but are less connected and contribute less to the overall connectivity than the average site and thus their loss does not disrupt the full network. Hence, the connectivity of the remaining network changed only slightly from present day conditions. Our findings highlight the need to establish species-specific management plans with flexible conservation strategies ensuring protection under potential future range expansions. Aquila pomarina is predicted to disappear from the southern part of its range and to become restricted to northeastern Europe. Gyps fulvus, Aquila chrysaetos, and Neophron percnopterus are predicted to locally lose some suitable sites; hence, some isolated small populations may become extinct. However, their geographical range and metapopulation structure will remain relatively unaffected throughout Europe. These species would benefit more from an improved habitat quality and management of the existing network of protected areas than from increased connectivity or assisted migration.},

Here, employing simple and general empirical arguments concerning the nature of movement, trophic position and behaviour we outline a general theory concerning the role of space and food web structure on food web stability. We argue that consumers link food webs in space and that this spatial structure combined with relatively rapid behavioural responses by consumers can strongly influence the dynamics of food webs. Employing simple spatially implicit food web models, we show that large mobile consumers are inordinately important in determining the stability, or lack of it, in ecosystems. More specifically, this theory suggests that mobile higher order organisms are potent stabilizers when embedded in a variable, and expansive spatial structure. However, when space is compressed and higher order consumers strongly couple local habitats then mobile consumers can have an inordinate destabilizing effect. Preliminary empirical arguments show consistency with this general theory.},

Increased human disturbance often results in declining local native species richness, gains in exotic species and a decline in beta diversity. However, it is far from certain whether a general decline in plant diversity is occurring across all disturbed landscapes, and knowledge gaps remain concerning how the spread of exotic species influences beta diversity over long time-scales. We resurveyed 184 vegetation plots in three broad vegetation types on southern Vancouver Island, Canada, originally surveyed in the late 1960s. This landscape has experienced a high degree of human disturbance over the past 40 years due to urbanization. We examined changes in total diversity, local diversity and beta diversity over time. We also compiled information on the traits of each species and tested for correlations between traits and plant species success over four decades. We found striking increases in local and total plant species richness driven by both native and exotic species. The most successful species tended to be exotic, disturbance tolerant, shade tolerant and shrubs. Biotic homogenization occurred, but not as a result of exotic species colonization, instead being significantly correlated with gains in native species. The loss in beta diversity has resulted in a shrinking of the gradient of vegetation types, blurring the distinction between them. Synthesis. Our study shows that human-mediated disturbance is the dominant driver of plant community changes, but the net result has actually been an increase in richness, for each plot and for all plots pooled, and for both natives and exotics, despite a decline in variability among plant communities on the landscape. Contrary to conventional definitions of biotic homogenization, this decline in beta diversity was not correlated with the spread of exotic species, but with the colonization of common, disturbance-tolerant natives.},

A major unknown in this work is the extent to which populations of trees will actually track climate shifts through migration. We therefore present two extreme scenarios in which species either move entirely into future climatic niches or do not move out of their current niches. In the full-dispersal scenario, future potential ranges show decreases and increases in size, with an average decrease of 12\% and a northward shift of 700 kilometers (km). In the no-dispersal scenario, potential ranges decrease in size by 58\% and shift northward by 330 km. Major redistribution pressures appear to be in order under both dispersal scenarios.},

We used chloroplast DNA surveys to show that the geography of postglacial range expansion in two eastern North American tree species differs from that expected from pollen-based reconstructions and from patterns emerging from European molecular studies. Molecular evidence suggests that American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and red maple (Acer rubrum) persisted during the late glaciation as low-density populations, perhaps within 500 km of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Because populations were closer to modern range limits than previously thought, postglacial migration rates may have been slower than those inferred from fossil pollen. Our estimated rates of Ͻ100 m/yr are consistent with model predictions based on life history and dispersal data, and suggest that past migration rates were substantially slower than the rates that will be needed to track 21st-century warming.},

  abstract = {Connectivity among populations and habitats is important for a wide range of ecological processes. Understanding, preserving, and restoring connectivity in complex landscapes requires connectivity models and metrics that are reliable, efficient, and process based. We introduce a new class of ecological connectivity models based in electrical circuit theory. Although they have been applied in other disciplines, circuit-theoretic connectivity models are new to ecology. They offer distinct advantages over common analytic connectivity models, including a theoretical basis in random walk theory and an ability to evaluate contributions of multiple dispersal pathways. Resistance, current, and voltage calculated across graphs or raster grids can be related to ecological processes (such as individual movement and gene flow) that occur across large population networks or landscapes. Efficient algorithms can quickly solve networks with millions of nodes, or landscapes with millions of raster cells. Here we review basic circuit theory, discuss relationships between circuit and random walk theories, and describe applications in ecology, evolution, and conservation. We provide examples of how circuit models can be used to predict movement patterns and fates of random walkers in complex landscapes and to identify important habitat patches and movement corridors for conservation planning.},

  abstract = {Landscape connectivity is crucial for many ecological processes, including dispersal, gene flow, demographic rescue, and movement in response to climate change. As a result, governmental and non-governmental organizations are focusing efforts to map and conserve areas that facilitate movement to maintain population connectivity and promote climate adaptation. In contrast, little focus has been placed on identifying barriers\textemdash{}landscape features which impede movement between ecologically important areas\textemdash{}where restoration could most improve connectivity. Yet knowing where barriers most strongly reduce connectivity can complement traditional analyses aimed at mapping best movement routes. We introduce a novel method to detect important barriers and provide example applications. Our method uses GIS neighborhood analyses in conjunction with effective distance analyses to detect barriers that, if removed, would significantly improve connectivity. Applicable in least-cost, circuit-theoretic, and simulation modeling frameworks, the method detects both complete (impermeable) barriers and those that impede but do not completely block movement. Barrier mapping complements corridor mapping by broadening the range of connectivity conservation alternatives available to practitioners. The method can help practitioners move beyond maintaining currently important areas to restoring and enhancing connectivity through active barrier removal. It can inform decisions on trade-offs between restoration and protection; for example, purchasing an intact corridor may be substantially more costly than restoring a barrier that blocks an alternative corridor. And it extends the concept of centrality to barriers, highlighting areas that most diminish connectivity across broad networks. Identifying which modeled barriers have the greatest impact can also help prioritize error checking of land cover data and collection of field data to improve connectivity maps. Barrier detection provides a different way to view the landscape, broadening thinking about connectivity and fragmentation while increasing conservation options.},

However, while most studies concerning the structure of food webs have shown a nonrandom pattern, it still remains unclear how this structure is related to compartmentalization and to responses to perturbations. Here we build a bridge between connectance, food web structure, and compartmentalization by studying how links are distributed within and between subwebs. A ``k subweb'' is defined as a subset of species that are connected to at least k species from the same subset. We study the k subweb frequency distribution (i.e., the number of k subwebs in each food web). This distribution is highly skewed, decaying in all cases as a power law. The most dense subweb has the most interactions, despite containing a small number of species, and shows connectivity values independent of species richness. The removal of the most dense subweb implies multiple fragmentation. Our results show a cohesive organization, that is, a high number of small subwebs highly connected among themselves through the most dense subweb. We discuss the implications of this organization in relation to different types of disturbances. Key words: cohesion; compartmentalization; connectance; food web structure; null model; subweb.},

  abstract = {Aim Climate is often regarded as the primary control determining the location of an ecotone between two vegetation zones. However, other ecological factors may also be important, especially when the northern limit of the dominant species of a vegetation zone extends further than the limit of the zone itself. This study aimed to identify the ecological variables explaining the transition between two zones within the boreal biome in Quebec (eastern Canada): the southern mixedwood forests dominated by balsam fir (Abies balsamea) and white birch (Betula papyrifera), and the northern coniferous forests dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana). Location Quebec (eastern Canada). Methods Data from 5023 sampling plots from the ecological inventory of the Qu{\'e}bec Ministry of Natural Resources distributed throughout the two bioclimatic zones were used in logistic regressions to determine the relationships between the presence or absence of balsam fir stands and different abiotic and biotic variables, at both stand and landscape scales. Results The presence of balsam fir stands was negatively related to the thick organic horizons, coarse xeric deposits and low positions on the slope, whereas stands were favoured by high elevations, steep slopes and moderate drainage. These results defined the suitable conditions for the development of balsam fir stands. In the coniferous zone these suitable conditions were less abundant. Furthermore, the saturation level of suitable sites was lower, as well as the incidence of balsam fir stands in unsuitable sites (overflow). Balsam fir stands were mostly located near lakes and rivers. All significant variables at both the stand and landscape scales explained between 34 and 42\% of the location of the potential northern distribution limit of the mixedwood zone. Main conclusions Our results suggest the important role of historical factors related to post-glacial vegetation and past disturbances in determining the relative abundance of balsam fir in both zones of the boreal biome.},

  abstract = {Human impacts on Earth's ecosystems have greatly intensified in the last decades. This is reflected in unexpected disturbance events, as well as new and increasing socio-economic demands, all of which are affecting the resilience of forest ecosystems worldwide and the provision of important ecosystem services. This Anthropocene era is forcing us to reconsider past and current forest management and silvicultural practices, and search for new ones that are more flexible and better at dealing with the increasing uncertainty brought about by these accelerating and cumulative global changes. Here, we briefly review the focus and limitations of past and current forest management and silvicultural practices mainly as developed in Europe and North America. We then discuss some recent promising concepts, such as managing forests as complex adaptive systems, and approaches based on resilience, functional diversity, assisted migration and multi-species plantations, to propose a novel approach to integrate the functionality of species-traits into a functional complex network approach as a flexible and multi-scale way to manage forests for the Anthropocene. This approach takes into consideration the high level of uncertainty associated with future environmental and societal changes. It relies on the quantification and dynamic monitoring of functional diversity and complex network indices to manage forests as a functional complex network. Using this novel approach, the most efficient forest management and silvicultural practices can be determined, as well as where, at what scale, and at what intensity landscape-scale resistance, resilience and adaptive capacity of forests to global changes can be improved.},

  abstract = {Drought-induced, regional-scale dieback of forests has emerged as a global concern that is expected to escalate under model projections of climate change. Since 2000, drought of unusual severity, extent, and duration has affected large areas of western North America, leading to regional-scale dieback of forests in the southwestern US. We report on drought impacts on forests in a region farther north, encompassing the transition between boreal forest and prairie in western Canada. A central question is the significance of drought as an agent of large-scale tree mortality and its potential future impact on carbon cycling in this cold region. We used a combination of plot-based, meteorological, and remote sensing measures to map and quantify aboveground, dead biomass of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) across an 11.5 Mha survey area where drought was exceptionally severe during 2001\textendash{}2002. Within this area, a satellite-based land cover map showed that aspen-dominated broadleaf forests occupied 2.3 Mha. Aerial surveys revealed extensive patches of severe mortality ({$>$}55\%) resembling the impacts of fire. Dead aboveground biomass was estimated at 45 Mt, representing 20\% of the total aboveground biomass, based on a spatial interpolation of plot-based measurements. Spatial variation in percentage dead biomass showed a moderately strong correlation with drought severity. In the prairie-like, southern half of the study area where the drought was most severe, 35\% of aspen biomass was dead, compared with an estimated 7\% dead biomass in the absence of drought. Drought led to an estimated 29 Mt increase in dead biomass across the survey area, corresponding to 14 Mt of potential future carbon emissions following decomposition. Many recent, comparable episodes of drought-induced forest dieback have been reported from around the world, which points to an emerging need for multiscale monitoring approaches to quantify drought effects on woody biomass and carbon cycling across large areas.},

Estimates from three previous studies are used to illustrate the utility of the sensitivity calculations: a joint occupancy model for a prey species, its predators, and habitat used by both; occurrence dynamics from a well-known metapopulation study of three butterfly species; and Golden Eagle occupancy and reproductive dynamics. I show how to deal efficiently with multistate models and how to calculate sensitivities involving derived state variables and lower-level parameters. In addition, I extend methods to incorporate environmental variation by allowing for spatial and temporal variability in transition probabilities. The approach used here is concise and general and can fully account for environmental variability in transition parameters. The methods can be used to improve inferences in occupancy studies by quantifying the effects of underlying parameters, aiding prediction of future system states, and identifying priorities for sampling effort.},

To date, the effects of warming on seedling recruitment have received little attention, in spite of forecasted forest expansion. Here, we used stand structure and environmental data from 95 white spruce (Picea glauca) plots sampled across a longitudinal gradient in southwest Alaska to explore factors influencing spruce establishment and recruitment near western treeline. We used total counts of live seedlings, saplings, and trees, representing five life stages, to evaluate whether geospatial, climate, and measured plot covariates predicted abundance, using current abundance distributions as a surrogate for climate conditions in the past. We used generalized linear models to test the null hypothesis that conditions favorable for recruitment were similar along the environmental gradient represented by longitude, by exploring relationships between per-plot counts of each life stage and the covariates hypothesized to affect abundance. We also examined the relationship between growing degree days (GDD) and seedling establishment over a period of three decades using tree-ring chronologies obtained from cores taken at a subset of our sites (n = 30). Our results indicated that seedling, sapling, and tree abundance were positively correlated with temperature across the study area. The response to longitude was mixed, with earlier life stages (seedlings, saplings) most abundant at the western end of the gradient, and later life stages (trees) most abundant to the east. The differential relationship between longitude and life-stage abundance suggests a moving front of white spruce establishment through time, driven by changes in environmental conditions near the species' western range limit. Likewise, we found a positive relationship between periods of seedling establishment and GDD, suggesting that longer summers and/or greater heat accumulation might enhance establishment, consistent with the positive relationship we found between life-stage abundance and temperature.},

  abstract = {To maximize specific ecosystem services (ES) such as food production, people alter landscape structure, i.e., the types of ecosystems present, their relative proportions, and their spatial arrangement across landscapes. This can have significant, and sometimes unexpected, effects on biodiversity and ES. Communities need information about how land-use activities and changes to landscape structure are likely to affect biodiversity and ES, but current scientific understanding of these effects is incomplete. The Mont{\'e}r{\'e}gie Connection (MC) project has used the rapidly suburbanizing agricultural Mont{\'e}r{\'e}gien landscape just east of Montreal, Qu{\'e}bec, Canada, to investigate how current and historic landscape structure influences ES provision. Our results highlight the importance of forest connectivity and functional diversity on ES provision, and show that ES provision can vary significantly even within single landuse types in response to changes in landscape structure. Our historical analysis reveals that levels of ES provision, as well as relationships among individual ES, can change dramatically through time. We are using these results to build quantitative ES-landscape structure models to assess four future landscape scenarios for the region: Periurban Development, Demand for Energy, Whole-System Crisis, and Green Development. These scenarios integrate empirical and historical data on ES provision with local stakeholder input about global and local social and ecological drivers to explore how land-use decisions could affect ES provision and human well-being across the region to the year 2045. By integrating empirical data, quantitative models, and scenarios we have achieved the central goals of the MC project: (1) increasing understanding of the effects of landscape structure on biodiversity and ES provision, (2) effectively linking this knowledge to decision making to better manage for biodiversity and ES, and (3) creating a vision for a more sustainable socialecological system in the region.},

  abstract = {Despite predictions of poleward and upslope shifts in the distribution of breeding passerines under climate change, studies often report variable responses with some species shifting opposite of the expected direction and others showing range stability. While changes in climate could affect distribution directly, passerines show strong preferences for particular structural vegetation characteristics, suggesting that long-\-term changes in vegetation may mediate a species' distributional response to climate, and consequently, may be responsible for the observed heterogeneity. We assessed changes in the elevational distribution and occupancy probability of 17 passerine species in Denali National Park, Alaska, from 1995 to 2013 across an elevational gradient containing multiple topographically defined ecotones (treeline and shrubline). An upward distributional shift was pervasive among shrub-t\-undra species, corresponding with observed expansion of shrub cover at higher elevations. Forest-a\- ssociated passerines showed a weaker response as a group with some species showing range stability or retraction, while others exhibited modest expansions that were consistent with an advancing treeline ecotone. Denali's mean summer temperature increased significantly over the past century, but remained relatively stable over our study period, implying that longer term changes in climate indirectly influenced bird distribution through changes in woody vegetation. Further, heterogeneity in the response of forest-\-associated species was consistent with a slower rate of forest development and expansion as compared with shrub colonization. Together, our results indicate that the elevational range dynamics of passerines may be related to species-s\- pecific associations with different vegetation communities and variation across these vegetation communities in the timescale over which distributional change is occurring.},

  abstract = {The practical value of a predictive metapopulation model is much affected by the amount of data required for parameter estimation. Some metapopulation models require information on population turnover events for parameterization, whereas other models, such as the incidence function model that is used in this study, can be parameterized with spatial data on patch occupancy. The latter data are more readily available. The original method of using spatial pattern data to parameterize the incidence function and other patch models has been criticized for involving potentially troublesome assumptions, such as the independence of habitat patches and constant colonization probabilities. This study describes an improved parameter estimation method that is not affected by these problems. The proposed method is based on Monte Carlo inference for implicit statistical models, and it can be adapted to any stochastic patch occupancy model of metapopulation dynamics. As an additional advantage, the new method allows the estimation of the amplitude of regional stochasticity. Tested with simulated data, the new method was found to produce substantially more accurate parameter estimates than the original method. The new approach is applied to two empirical metapopulations, the false heath fritillary butterfly in Finland and the American pika at Bodie, California.},

However, it is still unclear what evolutionary responses should be expected, at what rates, and whether evolution will save populations at risk of extinction. The potential of biological invasions to provide useful insights has barely been realised, despite the close analogies to species responding to global change, particularly climate change; in both cases, populations encounter novel climatic and biotic selection pressures, with expected evolutionary responses occurring over similar timescales. However, the analogy is not perfect, and invasive species are perhaps best used as an upper bound on expected change. In this article, we review what invasive species can and cannot teach us about likely evolutionary responses to global change and the constraints on those responses. We also discuss the limitations of invasive species as a model and outline directions for future research.},

We differentiate historical and contemporary views, and characterize physical and ecological processes that create and maintain climate change refugia. We then delineate how refugia can fit into existing decision support frameworks for climate adaptation and describe seven steps for managing them. Finally, we identify challenges and opportunities for operationalizing the concept of climate change refugia. Managing climate change refugia can be an important option for conservation in the face of ongoing climate change.},

First our results show that variability in productivity between stands differing in species composition decreases as species richness and functional diversity increase. Second we show temporal stability increases with increasing diversity due to compensatory dynamics across species, supporting the biodiversity insurance hypothesis. We demonstrate that this pattern is mainly driven by the asynchrony of species responses to small disturbances rather than to environmental fluctuations, and is only weakly affected by the net biodiversity effect on productivity. Furthermore, our results suggest that compensatory dynamics between species may enhance ecosystem stability through an optimisation of canopy occupancy by coexisting species.},

We explore the long-term relationship between diversity and productivity using a forest succession model. Extensive simulations show that tree species richness promotes productivity in European temperate forests across a large climatic gradient, mostly through strong complementarity between species. We show that this biodiversity effect emerges because increasing species richness promotes higher diversity in shade tolerance and growth ability, which results in forests responding faster to small-scale mortality events. Our study generalises results from short-term experiments in grasslands to forest ecosystems and demonstrates that competition for light alone induces a positive effect of biodiversity on productivity, thus providing a new angle for explaining BEF relationships.},

Key metrics of network structure were strongly affected by the size of the interaction matrix (i.e. the total number of interactions documented between individuals) and by the taxonomic diversity of the host taxa involved. After controlling for these sampling effects, quantitative networks showed no consistent structural patterns across latitude and host guilds, suggesting that there may be basic rules for how sets of antagonists interact with resource species.

Many tree species respond to disturbance by vegetative sprouting over sexual reproduction, but the ability to do so varies within and among species and is poorly studied. We tested the hypothesis that root sprouting in Fagus grandifolia is more important in high-elevation beech forests (extreme environmental conditions), relative to lower-elevation cove hardwood forests (optimal environmental conditions), in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. \textbullet{} Methods: Four cove hardwood and two high-elevation beech gap forests were sampled. Fagus grandifolia trees were tagged, mapped, and genotyped at each site using six nuclear microsatellite loci. A subset of trees was cored to determine minimum ages of identified clonal lineages. Relationships between measures of clonal richness, diameter, forest type, and elevation were compared by nonparametric analyses. \textbullet{} Key results: Five of six sites were highly dependent on sprouting; one site was entirely dependent on reproduction by seed. Clonal richness did not differ significantly by forest type or elevation, but differed significantly from previously published work. Tree diameter was significant by elevation and significant between the present study and previously published work. \textbullet{} Conclusions: The results of this study in the context of previously published work suggest that relatively recent recruits may be more likely to reflect both sexual and asexual strategies, whereas mature F. grandifolia may be more likely to be the result of persistent clonal lineages.},

Collapses have occurred frequently in history, often followed by centuries of economic, intellectual, and population decline. Many different natural and social phenomena have been invoked to explain specific collapses, but a general explanation remains elusive. In this paper, we build a human population dynamics model by adding accumulated wealth and economic inequality to a predator\textendash{}prey model of humans and nature. The model structure, and simulated scenarios that offer significant implications, are explained. Four equations describe the evolution of Elites, Commoners, Nature, and Wealth. The model shows Economic Stratification or Ecological Strain can independently lead to collapse, in agreement with the historical record. The measure ``Carrying Capacity'' is developed and its estimation is shown to be a practical means for early detection of a collapse. Mechanisms leading to two types of collapses are discussed. The new dynamics of this model can also reproduce the irreversible collapses found in history. Collapse can be avoided, and population can reach a steady state at maximum carrying capacity if the rate of depletion of nature is reduced to a sustainable level and if resources are distributed equitably.},

Traditionally, ecologists have explored linkages between the severity and type of disturbance and the taxonomic structure of communities. Recent advances in the application of species traits, to assess the functional structure of communities, have provided an alternative approach that responds rapidly and consistently across taxa and ecosystems to multiple disturbances. Importantly, trait-based metrics may provide advanced warning of disturbance to ecosystems because they do not need species loss to be reactive. Here, we synthesize empirical evidence and present a theoretical framework, based on species positions in a functional space, as a tool to reveal the complex nature of change in disturbed ecosystems.},

Low abundance and occupancy at expanding (high latitude) edges of the range may limit a species capacity to migrate, and at trailing (low latitude) edges, may result in range erosion and regional extinction. We examined abundance\textendash{}occupancy distributions across the geographic ranges of 102 eastern North American trees and looked for signatures reflecting capacity to respond to climate change. We found that 62\% of species display a signature consistent with higher climatic suitability in the northern latitudes of their range. However, our results suggest that the most common response is likely to involve range erosion in the south and limited range expansion in the north, possibly leading to an overall reduction in range size for many species. In particular, species with smaller ranges centred at lower latitudes may not have the capacity to successfully track the current rate of climate change.},

Each of these processes has been linked to forest community assembly, but their combined contributions to alpha and beta-diversity in forests has not been well explored. Here we use variance partitioning to analyze 40 000 individual trees of 49 species, collected within 137 ha of sampling area spread across a 900-ha temperate deciduous forest reserve in Pennsylvania to ask (1) To what extent is site-to-site variation in species richness and community composition of a temperate forest explained by measured environmental gradients and by spatial descriptors (used here to estimate dispersal-assembly or unmeasured, spatially structured processes)? (2) How does the incorporation of land-use history information increase the importance attributed to deterministic community assembly? and (3) How do the distributions and abundances of individual species within the community correlate with these factors? Environmental variables (i.e., topography, soils, and distance to stream), spatial descriptors (i.e., spatial eigenvectors derived from Cartesian coordinates), and land-use history variables (i.e., land-use type and intensity, forest age, and distance to road), explained about half of the variation in both species richness and community composition. Spatial descriptors explained the most variation, followed by measured environmental variables and then by land-use history. Individual species revealed variable responses to each of these sets of predictor variables. Several species were associated with stream habitats, and others were strictly delimited across opposing north- and south-facing slopes. Several species were also associated with areas that experienced recent (i.e., {$<$}100 years) human land-use impacts. These results indicate that deterministic factors, including environmental and land-use history variables, are important drivers of community response. The large amount of ``unexplained'' variation seen here (about 50\%) is commonly observed in other such studies attempting to explain distribution and abundance patterns of plant communities. Determining whether such large fractions of unaccounted for variation are caused by a lack of sufficient data, or are an indication of stochastic features of forest communities globally, will remain an important challenge for ecologists in the future.},

  abstract = {Species' ranges are complex often exhibiting multidirectional shifts over space and time. Despite the strong fingerprint of recent historical climate change on species' distributions, biotic factors such as loss of vegetative habitat and the presence of potential competitors constitute important yet often overlooked drivers of range dynamics. Furthermore, short-term changes in environmental conditions can influence the underlying processes of local extinction and local colonization that drive range shifts, yet are rarely considered at broad scales. We used dynamic state-space occupancy models to test multiple hypotheses of the relative importance of major drivers of range shifts of Goldenwinged Warblers (Vermivora chrysoptera) and Blue-winged Warblers (V. cyanoptera) between 1983 and 2012 across North America: warming temperatures; habitat changes; and occurrence of congeneric species, used here as proxy for biotic interactions. Dynamic occupancies for both species were most influenced by spatial relative to temporal variation in temperature and habitat. However, temporal variation in temperature anomalies and biotic interactions remained important. The two biotic factors considered, habitat change and biotic interactions, had the largest relative effect on estimated extinction rates followed by abiotic temperature anomalies. For the Golden-winged Warbler, the predicted presence of the Blue-winged Warbler, a hypothesized competitor, most influenced extinction probabilities, contributing to evidence supporting its role in site-level species replacement. Given the overall importance of biotic factors on range-wide dynamic occupancies, their consideration alongside abiotic factors should not be overlooked. Our results suggest that warming compounds the negative effect of habitat loss emphasizing species' need for habitat to adapt to a changing climate. Notably, even closely related species exhibited individual responses to abiotic and biotic factors considered.},

  abstract = {Accurate prediction of the ecological impacts of climatic change is a pressing challenge to the science of ecology. The current state of the art for broad\textemdash{}scale estimates of change in biomes and ecotones between biomes is limited to equilibrium estimates of ecological change under some future equilibrium climate. Uncertainties in these estimates abound, ranging from uncertainties in future climate scenarios to uncertainties in our ecological models and finally to uncertainties in modelling the feedbacks between the climate and the biosphere. Ecologists and policymakers need to go beyond equilibrium estimates of biosphere change to transient responses of the biosphere as the climate changes. Ecotones between biomes have been suggested as sensitive areas of change that could be effectively modelled and monitored for future change. Ecotones are also important in influencing local and regional biodiversity patterns and ecological flows. The ecological processes that could affect change at ecotones and within biomes are discussed; they include internal ecosystem processes, such as competition, and external abiotic processes, most notably drought and related disturbances. Drought followed by infestations and fire appears to be the most likely process that could mediate ecological change under a rapidly changing climate. The impacts would be apparent all across biomes, not just at ecotones. However, specific predictions about the dynamics of ecotones can be made qualitatively, based on a theory of patch scaling and diversity in relation to abiotic stressors. Under current conditions, the size of homogeneous patches is expected to be small at ecotones, but to enlarge with distance from the ecotone. Directional climatic change should promote a coalescence of patches on one side of the ecotone and increased fragmentation on the other side. Ecotones should begin to blur as viewed from a satellite only to re\textemdash{}form at some later date in a new location. This view is in contrast to the notion that ecotones would retain sharp distinction and simply move across the landscape. These changes are presented as hypotheses based on theory and should be testable in a mechanistic modeling framework that is only now being developed.},

What type of community can we expect in the future given current or novel conditions? We address these questions by comparing Markov chain community models among treatments from a field experiment on invasive species on Robinson Crusoe Island, Chile. Because of seed dispersal, grazing and disturbance, we predicted that the exotic European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) facilitates epizoochorous exotic plants (plants with seeds that stick to the skin an animal) at the expense of native plants. To test our hypothesis, we crossed rabbit exclosure treatments with disturbance treatments, and sampled the plant community in permanent plots over 3 years. We then estimated Markov chain model transition probabilities and found significant differences among treatments. As hypothesized, this modelling revealed that exotic plants survive better in disturbed areas, while natives prefer no rabbits or disturbance. Surprisingly, rabbits negatively affect epizoochorous plants. Markov chain dynamics indicate that an overall replacement of native plants by exotic plants is underway. Using a treatment-based approach to multi-species Markov chain models allowed us to examine the changes in the importance of mechanisms in response to experimental impacts on communities.},

Choice of future climates explained 9\% of total variability among projections.

  abstract = {Abstract Tree mortality is an important process in forest ecosystems, frequently hypothesized to be highly climate sensitive. Yet, tree death remains one of the least understood processes of forest dynamics. Recently, changes in tree mortality have been observed in forests around the globe, which could profoundly affect ecosystem functioning and services provisioning to society. We describe continental-scale patterns of recent tree mortality from the only consistent pan-European forest monitoring network, identifying recent mortality hotspots in southern and northern Europe. Analyzing 925,462 annual observations of 235,895 trees between 2000 and 2012, we determine the influence of climate variability and tree age on interannual variation in tree mortality using Cox proportional hazard models. Warm summers as well as high seasonal variability in precipitation increased the likelihood of tree death. However, our data also suggest that reduced cold-induced mortality could compensate increased mortality related to peak temperatures in a warming climate. Besides climate variability, age was an important driver of tree mortality, with individual mortality probability decreasing with age over the first century of a trees life. A considerable portion of the observed variation in tree mortality could be explained by satellite-derived net primary productivity, suggesting that widely available remote sensing products can be used as an early warning indicator of widespread tree mortality. Our findings advance the understanding of patterns of large-scale tree mortality by demonstrating the influence of seasonal and diurnal climate variation, and highlight the potential of state-of-the-art remote sensing to anticipate an increased likelihood of tree mortality in space and time.},

  abstract = {With the accumulating evidence of changing disturbance regimes becoming increasingly obvious, there is potential for disturbance ecology to become the most valuable lens through which climate-related disturbance events are interpreted. In this paper, I revisit some of the central themes of disturbance ecology and argue that the knowledge established in the field of disturbance ecology continues to be relevant to ecosystem management, even with rapid changes to disturbance regimes and changing disturbance types in local ecosystems. Disturbance ecology has been tremendously successful over the past several decades at elucidating the interactions between disturbances, biodiversity, and ecosystems, and this knowledge can be leveraged in different contexts. Primarily, management in changing and uncertain conditions should be focused primarily on the long-term persistence of that native biodiversity that has evolved within the local disturbance regime and is likely to go extinct with rapid changes to disturbance intensity, frequency, and type. Where possible, conserving aspects of natural disturbance regimes will be vital to preserving functioning ecosystems and to that native biodiversity that requires disturbance for its continued existence, though these situations may become more limited over time. Finally, scientists must actively propose management policies that incorporate knowledge of disturbance ecology. Successful policies regarding changing disturbance regimes for biodiversity will not merely be reactive, and will recognize that for natural ecosystems as for human society, not all desired outcomes are simultaneously possible.},

  abstract = {Landscapes and the ecological processes they support are inherently complex systems, in that they have large numbers of heterogeneous interacting components, interact in multiple ways, and exhibit scale dependence, non-linear dynamics, and emergent properties. The emergent properties of landscapes encompass a broad range of processes that influence biodiversity, ecosystem processes, and human environments. These properties, such as nutrient cycling, dispersal, evolutionary adaptation of organisms to their environments, and the focus of this article, ecological disturbance regimes (including wildfire), operate at scales that are relevant to human societies, but these are also often the scales at which ecosystem dynamics are most difficult to understand and predict. Modeling processes and interactions at the landscape scale, including future states of biological communities and their interactions with each other and with processes such as landscape fire, requires quantitative metrics and algorithms that minimize error propagation across scales. We identify three intrinsic limitations to progress in landscape ecology, and ecology in general: (1) the problem of coarse-graining, or how to aggregate fine-scale information to larger scales in a statistically unbiased manner; (2) the middle-number problem, which describes systems with elements that are too few and too varied to be amenable to global averaging, but too numerous and varied to be computationally tractable; and (3) non-stationarity, in modeled relationships or parameter choices that are valid in one environment but may not hold when projected onto future environments such as a warming climate. We illustrate these challenges with examples drawn from the context of landscape ecology and wildfire. Quantitative scaling relationships are the key to moving forward, and we review recent progress and paths to developing scaling laws in landscape ecology. We incorporate concepts of compression of state spaces from complexity theory to suggest ways to overcome the problems presented by coarse-graining, the middle-number domain, and non-stationarity.},

  abstract = {Population models for multiple species provide one of the few means of assessing the impact of alternative management options on the persistence of biodiversity, but they are inevitably uncertain. Is it possible to use population models in multiple-species conservation planning given the associated uncertainties? We use information-gap decision theory to explore the impact of parameter uncertainty on the conservation decision when planning for the persistence of multiple species. An information-gap approach seeks robust outcomes that are most immune from error. We assess the impact of uncertainty in key model parameters for three species, whose extinction risks under four alternative management scenarios are estimated using a metapopulation model. Three methods are described for making conservation decisions across the species, taking into account uncertainty. We find that decisions based on single species are relatively robust to uncertainty in parameters, although the estimates of extinction risk increase rapidly with uncertainty. When identifying the best conservation decision for the persistence of all species, the methods that rely on the rankings of the management options by each species result in decisions that are similarly robust to uncertainty. Methods that depend on absolute values of extinction risk are sensitive to uncertainty, as small changes in extinction risk can alter the ranking of the alternative scenarios. We discover that it is possible to make robust conservation decisions even when the uncertainties of the multiple-species problem appear overwhelming. However, the decision most robust to uncertainty is likely to differ from the best decision when uncertainty is ignored, illustrating the importance of incorporating uncertainty into the decision-making process.},

For conservation planning to be relevant, the impact of landscape configuration on population processes and the viability of species needs to be considered. We present a novel method for selecting reserve systems that maximize persistence across multiple species, subject to a conservation budget. We use a spatially explicit metapopulation model to estimate extinction risk, a function of the ecology of the species and the amount, quality and configuration of habitat. We compare our new method with more traditional, area-based reserve selection methods, using a ten-species case study, and find that the expected loss of species is reduced 20-fold. Unlike previous methods, we avoid designating arbitrary weightings between reserve size and configuration; rather, our method is based on population processes and is grounded in ecological theory.},

  abstract = {The first step in conservation planning is to identify objectives. Most stated objectives for conservation, such as to maximize biodiversity outcomes, are too vague to be useful within a decision-making framework. One way to clarify the issue is to define objectives in terms of the risk of extinction for multiple species. Although the assessment of extinction risk for single species is common, few researchers have formulated an objective function that combines the extinction risks of multiple species. We sought to translate the broad goal of maximizing the viability of species into explicit objectives for use in a decision-theoretic approach to conservation planning. We formulated several objective functions based on extinction risk across many species and illustrated the differences between these objectives with simple examples. Each objective function was the mathematical representation of an approach to conservation and emphasized different levels of threat. Our objectives included minimizing the joint probability of one or more extinctions, minimizing the expected number of extinctions, and minimizing the increase in risk of extinction from the best-case scenario. With objective functions based on joint probabilities of extinction across species, any correlations in extinction probabilities had to be known or the resultant decisions were potentially misleading. Additive objectives, such as the expected number of extinctions, did not produce the same anomalies. We demonstrated that the choice of objective function is central to the decision-making process because alternative objective functions can lead to a different ranking of management options. Therefore, decision makers need to think carefully in selecting and defining their conservation goals.},

  abstract = {Forest trees are exposed to a myriad of single and combined stresses with varying strength and duration throughout their lifetime, and many of the simultaneous and successive stress factors strongly interact. While much progress has been achieved in understanding the effects of single stresses on tree performance, multiple interacting stress effects cannot be adequately assessed from combination of single factor analyses. In particular, global change brings about novel combinations of severity and timing of different stresses, the effects of which on tree performance are currently hard to predict. Furthermore, the combinations of stresses commonly sustained by trees change during tree ontogeny. In addition, tree photosynthesis and growth rates decline with increasing tree age and size, while support biomass in roots, stem and branches accumulates and the concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates increase, collectively resulting in an enhancement of non-structural carbon pools. In this review, tree physiological responses to key environmental stress factors and their combinations are analyzed from seedlings to mature trees. The key conclusions of this analysis are that combined stresses can influence survival of large trees even more than chronic exposure to a single predictable stress such as drought. In addition, tree tolerance to many environmental stresses increases throughout the ontogeny as the result of accumulation of non-structural carbon pools, implying major change in sensing, response and acclimation to single and multiple stresses in trees of different size and age.},

  abstract = {Lack of information on ecological characteristics of species across different continents hinders development of general world-scale quantitative vegetation dynamic models. We constructed common scales of shade, drought, and waterlogging tolerance for 806 North American, European/West Asian, and East Asian temperate shrubs and trees representing about 40\% of the extant natural Northern Hemisphere species pool. These scales were used to test the hypotheses that shade tolerance is negatively related to drought and waterlogging tolerances, and that these correlations vary among continents and plant functional types. We observed significant negative correlations among shade and drought tolerance rankings for all data pooled, and separately for every continent and plant functional type, except for evergreen angiosperms. Another significant trade-off was found for drought and waterlogging tolerance for all continents, and for evergreen and deciduous angiosperms, but not for gymnosperms. For all data pooled, for Europe and East Asia, and for evergreen and deciduous angiosperms, shade tolerance was also negatively associated with waterlogging tolerance. Quantile regressions revealed that the negative relationship between shade and drought tolerance was significant for species growing in deep to moderate shade and that the negative relationship between shade and waterlogging tolerance was significant for species growing in moderate shade to high light, explaining why all relationships between different tolerances were negative according to general regression analyses. Phylogenetic signal in the tolerance to any one of the three environmental factors studied was significant but low, with only 21\textendash{}24\% of cladogram nodes exhibiting significant conservatism. The inverse relationships between different tolerances were significant in phylogenetically independent analyses both for the overall pool of species and for two multispecies genera (Pinus and Quercus) for which reliable molecular phylogenies were available. Only 2.6\textendash{}10.3\% of the species were relatively tolerant to two environmental stresses simultaneously (tolerance value {$\geq$}3), and only three species were tolerant to all three stresses, supporting the existence of functional trade-offs in adjusting to multiple environmental limitations.

Worldwide, forests are managed by one of two broad approaches\textemdash{}even- and uneven-aged silviculture. In recent decades, there has been rising public pressure against the systematic use of even-aged silviculture (especially clear-cutting) because of its perceived negative esthetic and ecological impacts. This led to an increased interest for uneven-aged silviculture. However, to date, there has been no worldwide ecological comparison of the two approaches, based on multiple indicators. Overall, for the 99 combinations of properties or processes verified (one study may have evaluated more than one property or process), we found nineteen (23) combinations that clearly showed uneven-aged silviculture improved the evaluated metrics compared to even-aged silviculture, eleven (16) combinations that showed the opposite, and 60 combinations that were equivocal. Furthermore, many studies were based on a limited study design without either a timescale (44 of the 76) or spatial (54 of the 76) scale consideration. Current views that uneven-aged silviculture is better suited than even-aged silviculture for maintaining ecological diversity and processes are not substantiated by our analyses. Our review, by studying a large range of indicators and many different taxonomic groups, also clearly demonstrates that no single approach can be relied on and that both approaches are needed to ensure a greater number of positive impacts. Moreover, the review clearly highlights the importance of maintaining protected areas as some taxonomic groups were found to be negatively affected no matter the management approach used.

First, forest disturbances during the 20th century and composition were mapped for two landscapes in the Du Li{\`e}vre watershed of southern Quebec. Our results show that, as well as dominating stands in the absence of fire, AS often rapidly developed dominance after fire, especially in the south of our study area. Similarly, a majority of AS-dominated stands clearcut in 1928 continued to be AS-dominated 60 years later. Second, we examined AS seedlings planted under two very contrasting light regimes. AS seedlings showed a combination of traits particularly adapted to tolerate shade under a low light regime. However, owing to a surprisingly high phenotypic plasticity, AS also exhibited efficient development under high light. This suggests the classification of AS as a late-successional species should indeed be revised and that generalist or trans-successional would be a more appropriate designation for this species. We discuss the ramifications of such a status revision, with an emphasis on the implications for its silviculture.},

I review properties of forest ecosystems and management options for enhancing the resistance and resilience of forests to climate change. Although forests, as a class, have proved resilient to past changes in climate, today's fragmented and degraded forests are more vulnerable. Adaptation of species to climate change can occur through phenotypic plasticity, evolution, or migration to suitable sites, with the latter probably the most common response in the past. Among the land-use and management practices likely to maintain forest biodiversity and ecological functions during climate change are (1) representing forest types across environmental gradients in reserves; (2) protecting climatic refugia at multiple scales; (3) protecting primary forests; (4) avoiding fragmentation and providing connectivity, especially parallel to climatic gradients; (5) providing buffer zones for adjustment of reserve boundaries; (6) practicing low-intensity forestry and preventing conversion of natural forests to plantations; ( 7) maintaining natural fire regimes; (8) maintaining diverse gene pools; and (9) identifying and protecting functional groups and keystone species. Good forest management in a time of rapidly changing climate differs little from good forest management under more static conditions, but there is increased emphasis on protecting climatic refugia and providing connectivity.},

Forecasting which trees in which locations are vulnerable to drought-induced mortality is important to predict the consequences of drought on forest structure, biodiversity and ecosystem function. In this paper, our central aim was to compile a synthesis of tree traits and associated abiotic variables that can be used to predict drought-induced mortality. We reviewed the literature that specifically links drought mortality to functional traits and site conditions (i.e. edaphic variables and biotic conditions), targeting studies that show clear use of tree traits in drought analysis. We separated the review into five climatic zones to determine global vs. regionally restricted relationships between traits and mortality. Our synthesis identifies a number of traits that have clear relationships with drought-induced mortality (e.g. wood density at the species level and tree size and growth at the individual level). However, the lack of direct relationships between most traits and drought-induced mortality highlights areas where future research should focus to broaden our understanding. Synthesis and applications. Our synthesis highlights established relationships between traits and drought-induced mortality, presents knowledge gaps for future research focus and suggests monitoring and research avenues for improving our understanding of drought-induced mortality.

Climate change predictions suggest changes in precipitation regimes, which will affect the availability of water resources, with potential consequences for landscape connectivity. The Greater Calakmul Region of the Yucatan Peninsula (Mexico) has experienced a 16\% decrease in precipitation over the last 50 years, which we hypothesise has affected water resource connectivity. We used a network model of connectivity, for three large endangered species (Baird's tapir, white-lipped peccary and jaguar), to assess the effect of drought on waterhole availability and connectivity in a forested landscape inside and adjacent to the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve. We used reported travel distances and home ranges for our species to establish movement distances in our model. Specifically, we compared the effects of 10 drought scenarios on the number of waterholes (nodes) and the subsequent changes in network structure and node importance. Our analysis revealed that drought dramatically influenced spatial structure and potential connectivity of the network. Our results show that waterhole connectivity and suitable habitat (area surrounding waterholes) is lost faster inside than outside the reserve for all three study species, an outcome that may drive them outside the reserve boundaries. These results emphasize the need to assess how the variability in the availability of seasonal water resource may affect the viability of animal populations under current climate change inside and outside protected areas.},

  abstract = {Aim Biotic homogenization describes the process by which species invasions and extinctions increase the genetic, taxonomic or functional similarity of two or more biotas over a specified time interval. The study of biotic homogenization is a young and rapidly emerging research area in the budding field of conservation biogeography, and this paper aims to synthesize our current knowledge of this process and advocate a more systematic approach to its investigation. Methods Based on a comprehensive examination of the primary literature this paper reviews the process of biotic homogenization, including its definition, quantification, underlying ecological mechanisms, environmental drivers, the empirical evidence for different taxonomic groups, and the potential ecological and evolutionary implications. Important gaps in our knowledge are then identified, and areas of new research that show the greatest promise for advancing our current thinking on biotic homogenization are highlighted. Results Current knowledge of the patterns, mechanisms and implications of biotic homogenization is highly variable across taxonomic groups, but in general is incomplete. Quantitative estimates are almost exclusively limited to freshwater fishes and plants in the United States, and the principal mechanisms and drivers of homogenization remain elusive. To date research has focused on taxonomic homogenization, and genetic and functional homogenization has received inadequate attention. Trends over the past decade, however, suggest that biotic homogenization is emerging as a topic of greater research interest. Main conclusions My investigation revealed a number of important knowledge gaps and priority research needs in the science of biotic homogenization. Future studies should examine the homogenization process for different community properties (species occurrence and abundance) at multiple spatial and temporal scales, with careful attention paid to the various biological mechanisms (invasions vs. extinctions) and environmental drivers (environmental alteration vs. biotic interactions) involved. Perhaps most importantly, this research should recognize that there are multiple possible outcomes resulting from the accumulation of species invasions and extinctions, including biotic differentiation whereby genetic, taxonomic or functional similarity of biotas decreases over time.},

  abstract = {The widespread replacement of native species with cosmopolitan, nonnative species is homogenizing the global fauna and flora. While the empirical study of biotic homogenization is substantial and growing, theoretical aspects have yet to be explored. Consequently, the breadth of possible ecological mechanisms that can shape current and future patterns and rates of homogenization remain largely unknown. Here, we develop a conceptual model that describes 14 potential scenarios by which species invasions and/or extinctions can lead to various trajectories of biotic homogenization (increased community similarity) or differentiation (decreased community similarity); we then use a simulation approach to explore the model's predictions. We found changes in community similarity to vary with the type and number of nonnative and native species, the historical degree of similarity among the communities, and, to a lesser degree, the richness of the recipient communities. Homogenization is greatest when similar species invade communities, causing either no extinction or differential extinction of native species. The model predictions are consistent with current empirical data for fish, bird, and plant communities and therefore may represent the dominant mechanisms of contemporary homogenization. We present a unifying model illustrating how the balance between invading and extinct species dictates the outcome of biotic homogenization. We conclude by discussing a number of critical but largely unrecognized issues that bear on the empirical study of biotic homogenization, including the importance of spatial scale, temporal scale, and data resolution. We argue that the study of biotic homogenization needs to be placed in a more mechanistic and predictive framework in order for studies to provide adequate guidance in conservation efforts to maintain regional distinctness of the global biota.},

The objective of this study was to elucidate the dynamics of tree species composition at the sample plot level in relation to the initial composition when the experiment was established (1953\textendash{}1957) and harvest disturbance history following a wide range of even-aged and uneven-aged silvicultural treatments. Cluster analysis revealed three groupings of sample plots based on pretreatment composition and harvest disturbance history, or nine subclusters (i.e., three harvest disturbance histories nested within each pretreatment composition). From 1953 to 2005, the silvicultural treatments generated an array of compositional outcomes at the plot level. Hardwood dominance increased following a history of heavy and infrequent harvests, while northern conifer dominance was maintained where harvests were lighter and more frequent. The importance of balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) changed little across a range of harvest intensities. A ubiquitous decline in northern white-cedar (Thuja occidentalis L.) was found among silvicultural treatments, suggesting that additional intervention may be needed to promote cedar recruitment. Plot-level compositional dynamics indicated that neighborhood-scale stand dynamics were associated with variability in harvest disturbance overlain on plot-to-plot variability in tree species composition at the time the experiment was established.},

  abstract = {Species distribution modeling (SDM) is an important tool to assess the impact of global environmental change. Many species exhibit ecologically relevant intraspecific variation, and few studies have analyzed its relevance for SDM. Here, we compared three SDM techniques for the highly variable species Pinus contorta. First, applying a conventional SDM approach, we used MaxEnt to model the subject as a single species (species model), based on presence\textendash{}absence observations. Second, we used MaxEnt to model each of the three most prevalent subspecies independently and combined their projected distributions (subspecies model). Finally, we used a universal growth transfer function (UTF), an approach to incorporate intraspecific variation utilizing provenance trial tree growth data. Different model approaches performed similarly when predicting current distributions. MaxEnt model discrimination was greater (AUC \textendash{} species model: 0.94, subspecies model: 0.95, UTF: 0.89), but the UTF was better calibrated (slope and bias \textendash{} species model: 1.31 and {\`A}0.58, subspecies model: 1.44 and {\`A}0.43, UTF: 1.01 and 0.04, respectively). Contrastingly, for future climatic conditions, projections of lodgepole pine habitat suitability diverged. In particular, when the species' intraspecific variability was acknowledged, the species was projected to better tolerate climatic change as related to suitable habitat without migration (subspecies model: 26\% habitat loss or UTF: 24\% habitat loss vs. species model: 60\% habitat loss), and given unlimited migration may increase amount of suitable habitat (subspecies model: 8\% habitat gain or UTF: 12\% habitat gain vs. species model: 51\% habitat loss) in the climatic period 2070\textendash{}2100 (SRES A2 scenario, HADCM3). We conclude that models derived from within-species data produce different and better projections, and coincide with ecological theory. Furthermore, we conclude that intraspecific variation may buffer against adverse effects of climate change. A key future research challenge lies in assessing the extent to which species can utilize intraspecific variation under rapid environmental change.},

We argue that processes at two levels of spatial scale interact: the metapopulation level and the species range level. Current concepts of spatially dynamic metapopulations and species ranges are consistent, and integration improves our understanding of the interaction of landscape level and geographical range level processes. In landscape zones in which the degree of habitat fragmentation allows persistence, the shifting of ranges is inhibited, but not blocked. In areas where the spatial cohesion of the habitat is below the critical level of metapopulation persistence, the expansion of ranges will be blocked. An increased frequency of large-scale disturbances caused by extreme weather events will cause increasing gaps and an overall contraction of the distribution range, particularly in areas with relatively low levels of spatial cohesion. Taking into account the effects of climate change on metapopulations, habitat distribution and land use changes, future biodiversity research and conservation strategies are facing the challenge to re-orient their focus and scope by integrating spatially and conceptually more dynamic aspects at the landscape level.},

The 19th century boreal forest landscape was shaped by recurrent forest fires and was characterized by continuous multistoried old-growth forest, containing also a deciduous component that no longer exists. Our data indicate that many of the interpretations of previous natural landscape properties used as base-line conditions in forest management must be seriously questioned.

Specifically, we analyse four alternative measures: the contribution of a fragment to the metapopulation capacity of the network, to the equilibrium metapopulation size, to the expected time to metapopulation extinction and the long-term contribution of a fragment to colonization events in the network. The latter measure is comparable to densitydependent measures in general matrix population theory, though some differences are introduced by the fact that ``density dependence'' is spatially localized in the metapopulation context. We show that the value of a fragment depends not only on the properties of the landscape but also on the properties of the species. Most importantly, variation in fragment values between the habitat fragments is greatest in the case of rare species that occur close to the extinction threshold, as these species are likely to be restricted to the most favorable parts of the landscape. We expect that the measures of habitat fragment value described and analysed here have applications in landscape ecology and in conservation biology.},

  abstract = {Community ecology aims to understand what factors determine the assembly and dynamics of species assemblages at different spatiotemporal scales. To facilitate the integration between conceptual and statistical approaches in community ecology, we propose Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC) as a general, flexible framework for modern analysis of community data. While non-manipulative data allow for only correlative and not causal inference, this framework facilitates the formulation of data-driven hypotheses regarding the processes that structure communities. We model environmental filtering by variation and covariation in the responses of individual species to the characteristics of their environment, with potential contingencies on species traits and phylogenetic relationships. We capture biotic assembly rules by species-to-species association matrices, which may be estimated at multiple spatial or temporal scales. We operationalise the HMSC framework as a hierarchical Bayesian joint species distribution model, and implement it as R- and Matlab-packages which enable computationally efficient analyses of large data sets. Armed with this tool, community ecologists can make sense of many types of data, including spatially explicit data and time-series data. We illustrate the use of this framework through a series of diverse ecological examples.},

  abstract = {Spatially structured populations in patchy habitats show much variation in migration rate, from patchy populations in which individuals move repeatedly among habitat patches to classic metapopulations with infrequent migration among discrete populations. To establish a common framework for population dynamics in patchy habitats, we describe an individual-based model (IBM) involving a diffusion approximation of correlated random walk of individual movements. As an example, we apply the model to the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) inhabiting a highly fragmented landscape. We derive stochastic patch occupancy model (SPOM) approximations for the IBMs assuming pure demographic stochasticity, uncorrelated environmental stochasticity, or completely correlated environmental stochasticity in local dynamics. Using realistic parameter values for the Glanville fritillary, we show that the SPOMs mimic the behavior of the IBMs well. The SPOMs derived from IBMs have parameters that relate directly to the life history and behavior of individuals, which is an advantage for model interpretation and parameter estimation. The modeling approach that we describe here provides a unified framework for patchy populations with much movements among habitat patches and classic metapopulations with infrequent movements.},

It then analyzes the warming trends in Ontario based on data from two weather stations with continuous records of more than 120years, to determine the rate of warming in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Region. The results indicate a temperature increase of about 0.76"C per century and an 8\% increase in annual total precipitation. Current climate change models indicate that for a scenario of 2 x C 0 2levels some general, probable prognoses can be made, including a temperature increase of up to 4.S\textdegree{}C, which might be disastrous for existing forest ecosystems. Specifically, the consequences of climate warming on (a) northward shifts of ecological conditions, (b) forest productivity, and (c) forest physiology and health, are examined. In the context of global warming, the paper then recommends practical management measures necessary to ensure adaptation of existing forest ecosystems to the warming that is already developing. These measures are intended to provide a no-risk environment for existing forests until rotation age. Next, a wide range of mitigative measures is examined with a view to securing the longterm preservation of forest ecosystems to avoid major ecological disruptions and, gradually, to reverse climate warming. Application of these measures requires international consensus, but countries that apply these recommendations first have a chance to profit from them due to the "C02 fertilization" effect.},

And (2) What are the strength and nature of the correlation between phylogeny and functional traits according to the evolutionary scale considered? We used data from permanent forest plots of northeastern Canada for which these links have been demonstrated and important functional traits identified. We show that the nature of the relationship between traits and phylogeny varies dramatically among traits, but also according to the evolutionary distance considered. The demonstration that different characters show phylogenetic autocorrelation at different evolutionary depths suggests that phylogenetic content of traits may be too crude to determine whether phylogenies contain relevant information. However, our study provides support for the use of phylogenies to assess ecosystem functioning when key functional traits are unavailable. We also highlight a potentially important contribution of phylogenetics for conservation and the study of the impact of biodiversity loss on ecosystem functioning and the provision of services, given the accumulating evidence that mechanisms promoting diversity effects shift over time to involve different traits.},

Range-restricted species, particularly polar and mountaintop species, show severe range contractions and have been the first groups in which entire species have gone extinct due to recent climate change. Tropical coral reefs and amphibians have been most negatively affected. Predator-prey and plant-insect interactions have been disrupted when interacting species have responded differently to warming. Evolutionary adaptations to warmer conditions have occurred in the interiors of species' ranges, and resource use and dispersal have evolved rapidly at expanding range margins. Observed genetic shifts modulate local effects of climate change, but there is little evidence that they will mitigate negative effects at the species level.},

We examined the influence of varying minimum mapping unit (MMU) and spatial extent on the prioritization of patches by their importance for the conservation of overall landscape connectivity, according to 10 different metrics as management support tools. We analyzed the forest patches distribution in three study zones within Spain with diverse spatial configuration from CORINE land cover data. Our results showed that the probability of connectivity, the area-weighted flux and the integral index of connectivity are the most robust metrics in terms of patches prioritization, while the results provided by the number of components, graph diameter and class coincidence probability are strongly scale-dependent. We found that scale sensitivity of the overall landscape metric value is not related to scale sensitivity in terms of patches prioritization. We provide guidelines for an appropriate selection of connectivity metrics and scale of analysis for landscape conservation planning and related applications.},

This paper attempts to evaluate (1) if and how emulation of natural disturbances (END) is being used as a conceptual bases for implementing EM, and more particularly, what strategies are used to define the natural forest of reference, and (2) what temporal and spatial scale strategies are being considered for seven important retention elements (downed woody debris, snags, green trees, corridors, riparian buffers, large patches and old forest)? To conduct this evaluation, five guides from four geographically well-distributed regions in North America are compared. Although END is the central conceptual foundation underlying four of the five guides, a natural forest of reference is not always clearly identified and none of the guides consider future impacts due to global change. The major weakness common to all five guides is the lack of consideration of long-term forest dynamics, particularly the lack of clear strategies for retention elements at a temporal scale longer than a single rotation. Generally, the spatial scales chosen for retention elements are not well-justified ecologically and targets for each retention element are not identified at different spatial scales. We stress that strong efforts have been made to develop forest management that incorporates some elements of natural variability and which considers societal needs, but further improvements are required. We conclude by presenting some suggestions to improve the approach. For example, creating more realistic guidelines in integrating current and future forest dynamics with pre-settlement information and planning rotation lengths that are inspired by the dominant natural disturbance.},

In particular, white spruce (Picea glauca) tree line populations distributed between 56\textdegree{} N and 58\textdegree{} N and 61\textdegree{} W and 66\textdegree{} W show contrasted responses to recent changes in climate according to their geographic position relative to the Labrador Sea. Along the coast, the northernmost latitudinal and altitudinal tree lines responded positively to warming over the last 50 years with invading spruce several tens of meters above the current tree line. In contrast, white spruce tree lines across the wind-exposed Labrador plateau are located much higher in altitude and have receded a few tens of meters beginning around AD 1740\textendash{}1750 and have not yet recovered. Whereas no field evidence of recent fire and insect damage was found, all inland tree line stands were progressively damaged likely due to mechanical defoliation of wind-exposed trees. Massive tree death in the 19th century caused a reduction in the number of seed-bearing trees, and declining tree lines were not replenished by seedlings. Recent warming reported for northern latitudes has not been strong enough to change the regressive tree line trajectory in interior Labrador. However, white spruce expansion above coastal tree line in the northernmost forest site in Labrador is in line with current climatic trends. It is hypothesized that the species is still advancing toward its potential tree line higher in altitude due to delayed postglacial migration. The slow advance of white spruce in northernmost coastal Labrador is likely caused by the rugged topography of the Torngat-Kaumajet-Kiglapait mountains.},

Although recovery of the spruce forest after an insect infestation or a fire is possible under current site conditions, it is less likely when both types of disturbance occur during a short period of time. The addition of yet another disturbance, such as tree harvesting, can thus have catastrophic consequences. We analyzed the impact of three successive disturbances\textemdash{}tree harvesting, insect infestation, and fire\textemdash{}on the regeneration of boreal spruce\textendash{}moss forests within a period of approximately 50 years. The spruce forests were harvested in the 1940s and the 1950s. Recovery from the logging consisted of advance regeneration (spruce layers less than 1 m high that were left intact during clear-cuts), which was burned in 1991. The vegetation cover (mostly heath and lichen species) and soil conditions (acidic, nutrient-poor podzolic soils developed from coarse materials) of the postfire sites that we studied were similar. Stand structure and tree regeneration were documented from large quadrats (0.25 ha) using age, size, and tree ring data from postlogged and postfire spruce. At an early stage of development, the growing advance regeneration was damaged by insect defoliators in the late 1970s and the mid-1980s, and several trees died a few years before the 1991 fire. The successive disturbances considerably reduced the number of seed-bearers, leading to the collapse of postfire regeneration and a shift to parkland. Through a successional trajectory far from the expected trend for boreal forests influenced by single disturbance, the shift resulted in the formation of divergent plant communities.

Structured Abstract
BACKGROUNDThe success of human societies depends intimately on the living components of natural and managed systems. Although the geographical range limits of species are dynamic and fluctuate over time, climate change is impelling a universal redistribution of life on Earth. For marine, freshwater, and terrestrial species alike, the first response to changing climate is often a shift in location, to stay within preferred environmental conditions. At the cooler extremes of their distributions, species are moving poleward, whereas range limits are contracting at the warmer range edge, where temperatures are no longer tolerable. On land, species are also moving to cooler, higher elevations; in the ocean, they are moving to colder water at greater depths. Because different species respond at different rates and to varying degrees, key interactions among species are often disrupted, and new interactions develop. These idiosyncrasies can result in novel biotic communities and rapid changes in ecosystem functioning, with pervasive and sometimes unexpected consequences that propagate through and affect both biological and human communities.
ADVANCESAt a time when the world is anticipating unprecedented increases in human population growth and demands, the ability of natural ecosystems to deliver ecosystem services is being challenged by the largest climate-driven global redistribution of species since the Last Glacial Maximum. We demonstrate the serious consequences of this species redistribution for economic development, livelihoods, food security, human health, and culture, and we document feedbacks on climate itself. As with other impacts of climate change, species range shifts will leave ``winners'' and ``losers'' in their wake, radically reshaping the pattern of human well-being between regions and different sectors and potentially leading to substantial conflict. The pervasive impacts of changes in species distribution transcend single systems or dimensions, with feedbacks and linkages between multiple interacting scales and through whole ecosystems, inclusive of humans. We argue that the negative effects of climate change cannot be adequately anticipated or prepared for unless species responses are explicitly included in decision-making and global strategic frameworks.
OUTLOOKDespite mounting evidence for the pervasive and substantial impacts of a climate-driven redistribution of Earth's species, current global goals, policies, and international agreements fail to account for these effects. With the predicted intensification of species movements and their diverse societal and environmental impacts, awareness of species ``on the move'' should be incorporated into local, regional, and global assessments as standard practice. This will raise hope that future targets\textemdash{}whether they be global sustainability goals, plans for regional biodiversity maintenance, or local fishing or forestry harvest strategies\textemdash{}can be achievable and that society is prepared for a world of universal ecological change. Human society has yet to appreciate the implications of unprecedented species redistribution for life on Earth, including for human lives. Even if greenhouse gas emissions stopped today, the responses required in human systems to adapt to the most serious effects of climate-driven species redistribution would be massive. Meeting these challenges requires governance that can anticipate and adapt to changing conditions, as well as minimize negative consequences. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/355/6332/eaai9214/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint As the global climate changes, human well-being, ecosystem function, and even climate itself are increasingly affected by the shifting geography of life.Climate-driven changes in species distributions, or range shifts, affect human well-being both directly (for example, through emerging diseases and changes in food supply) and indirectly (by degrading ecosystem health). Some range shifts even create feedbacks (positive or negative) on the climate system, altering the pace of climate change.
Distributions of Earth's species are changing at accelerating rates, increasingly driven by human-mediated climate change. Such changes are already altering the composition of ecological communities, but beyond conservation of natural systems, how and why does this matter? We review evidence that climate-driven species redistribution at regional to global scales affects ecosystem functioning, human well-being, and the dynamics of climate change itself. Production of natural resources required for food security, patterns of disease transmission, and processes of carbon sequestration are all altered by changes in species distribution. Consideration of these effects of biodiversity redistribution is critical yet lacking in most mitigation and adaptation strategies, including the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals.},

  abstract = {Connectivity models are useful tools that improve the ability of researchers and managers to plan land use for conservation and preservation. Most connectivity models function in a point-to-point or patch-to-patch fashion, limiting their use for assessing connectivity over very large areas. In large or highly fragmented systems, there may be so many habitat patches of interest that assessing connectivity among all possible combinations is prohibitive. To overcome these conceptual and practical limitations, we hypothesized that minor adaptation of the Circuitscape model can allow the creation of omnidirectional connectivity maps illustrating flow paths and variations in the ease of travel across a large study area. We tested this hypothesis in a 24,300 km2 study area centered on the Monte\textasciiacute{}re\textasciiacute{}gie region near Montre\textasciiacute{}al, Que\textasciiacute{}bec. We executed the circuit model in overlapping tiles covering the study region. Current was passed across the surface of each tile in orthogonal directions, and then the tiles were reassembled to create directional and omnidirectional maps of connectivity. The resulting mosaics provide a continuous view of connectivity in the entire study area at the full original resolution. We quantified differences between mosaics created using different tile and buffer sizes and developed a measure of the prominence of seams in mosaics formed with this approach. The mosaics clearly show variations in current flow driven by subtle aspects of landscape composition and configuration. Shown prominently in mosaics are pinch points, narrow corridors where organisms appear to be required to traverse when moving through the landscape. Using modest computational resources, these continuous, fine-scale maps of nearly unlimited size allow the identification of movement paths and barriers that affect connectivity. This effort develops a powerful new application of circuit models by pinpointing areas of importance for conservation, broadening the potential for addressing intriguing questions about resource use, animal distribution, and movement.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the practical and financial implications of alternative strategies for meeting explicit conservation goals on the Agulhas Plain, South Africa. This is an area of exceptional biodiversity increasingly threatened by alien plant infestation, urbanisation, and agricultural expansion. In addition to traditional on-reserve protection, we identify two types of property-rights agreements (conservation easements and management agreements) and two types of financial incentives (land management assistance and tax relief) as appropriate for encouraging off-reserve conservation on targeted lands in the area. Specifically, we suggest actions to offset the costs facing landowners under new pieces of legislation, such as alien-clearing requirements and a property tax. After refining an existing GIS database of cadastral units targeted for conservation, we assigned on- or off-reserve conservation status to properties on the basis of a simple decision system, which took the irreplaceability of the area into account. Three implementation scenarios were designed: an entirely `on-reserve' approach, a mixed on- and off-reserve approach, and the mixed approach in conjunction with financial incentives. The conservation costs, to both the public and private sector (including expanded obligations from new legislation), were first modelled and then analysed in a Geographic Information System. We found that a traditional on-reserve approach would cost the state about R240M in acquisition costs, whereas both mixed approaches, using the decision rules developed in this study, would involve leaving 40\% of targeted areas in private hands, saving the state 80\% in acquisition costs. Of the subsequent conservation costs, which total R401M (present value @ 6\% discount rate; Scenario 1), most are alien clearing costs. Since landowners are now compelled to put up these costs, the state could make further savings (44\textendash{}51\%) under a mixed management scenario. Using Property Rate relief as an additional financial incentive is relatively efficient in that it may save targeted private landowners 32\% in Property Rates, at a cost of 5.5\% of expected tax revenue to the state. Given the prohibitive costs, realising conservation goals in the Agulhas Plain will probably depend upon the establishment of institutions, mechanisms, and incentives for private participation in conservation.},

  abstract = {Establishing relationships between species distributions and environmental characteristics is a major goal in the search for forces driving species distributions. Canonical ordinations such as redundancy analysis and canonical correspondence analysis are invaluable tools for modeling communities through environmental predictors. They provide the means for conducting direct explanatory analysis in which the association among species can be studied according to their common and unique relationships with the environmental variables and other sets of predictors of interest, such as spatial variables. Variation partitioning can then be used to test and determine the likelihood of these sets of predictors in explaining patterns in community structure. Although variation partitioning in canonical analysis is routinely used in ecological analysis, no effort has been reported in the literature to consider appropriate estimators so that comparisons between fractions or, eventually, between different canonical models are meaningful. In this paper, we show that variation partitioning as currently applied in canonical analysis is biased. We present appropriate unbiased estimators. In addition, we outline a statistical test to compare fractions in canonical analysis. The question addressed by the test is whether two fractions of variation are significantly different from each other. Such assessment provides an important step toward attaining an understanding of the factors patterning community structure. The test is shown to have correct Type I error rates and good power for both redundancy analysis and canonical correspondence analysis.},

Projections emphasizing range shifts at continental scale, however, can mask contrasting patterns at local or regional scale where management and policy decisions are made. Moreover, models usually show potential for areas to become climatically unsuitable, remain suitable, or become suitable for a particular species with climate change, but each of these outcomes raises markedly different ecological and management issues. Managing forest decline at sites where climatic stress is projected to increase is likely to be the most immediate challenge resulting from climate change. Here we assess habitat suitability with climate change for five dominant tree species of eastern North American forests, focusing on areas of greatest vulnerability (loss of suitability in the baseline range) in Quebec (Canada) rather than opportunities (increase in suitability). Results show that these species are at risk of maladaptation over a remarkably large proportion of their baseline range. Depending on species, 5\textendash{}21\% of currently climatically suitable habitats are projected to be at risk of becoming unsuitable. This suggests that species that have traditionally defined whole regional vegetation assemblages could become less adapted to these regions, with significant impact on ecosystems and forest economy. In spite of their well-recognised limitations and the uncertainty that remains, regionally-explicit risk assessment approaches remain one of the best options to convey that message and the need for climate policies and forest management adaptation strategies.},

These events result in surprises that cannot easily be predicted based on information obtained at a single scale. Progress on catastrophic events has focused on one of the following two areas: nonlinear dynamics through time without an explicit consideration of spatial connectivity [Holling, C. S. (1992) Ecol. Monogr. 62, 447\textendash{}502] or spatial connectivity and the spread of contagious processes without a consideration of cross-scale interactions and feedbacks [Zeng, N., Neeling, J. D., Lau, L.

We provide an interdisciplinary, conceptual, and general mathematical framework for understanding and forecasting nonlinear dynamics through time and across space. We illustrate the generality and usefulness of our approach by using new data and recasting published data from ecology (wildfires and desertification), epidemiology (infectious diseases), and engineering (structural failures). We show that decisions that minimize the likelihood of catastrophic events must be based on cross-scale interactions, and such decisions will often be counterintuitive. Given the continuing challenges associated with global change, approaches that cross disciplinary boundaries to include interactions and feedbacks at multiple scales are needed to increase our ability to predict catastrophic events and develop strategies for minimizing their occurrence and impacts. Our framework is an important step in developing predictive tools and designing experiments to examine cross-scale interactions.},

These interactions change the pattern\textendash{}process relationships across scales such that fine-scale processes can influence a broad spatial extent or a long time period, or broad-scale drivers can interact with fine-scale processes to determine system dynamics. Cross\textendash{}scale interactions are increasing recognized as having important influences on ecosystem processes, yet they pose formidable challenges for understanding and forecasting ecosystem dynamics. In this introduction to the special feature, ``Cross\textendash{}scale interactions and pattern\textendash{}process relationships'', we provide a synthetic framework for understanding the causes and consequences of cross\textendash{}scale interactions. Our framework focuses on the importance of transfer processes and spatial heterogeneity at intermediate scales in linking fine- and broad-scale patterns and processes. Transfer processes and spatial heterogeneity can either amplify or attenuate system response to broad-scale drivers. Providing a framework to explain cross\textendash{}scale interactions is an important step in improving our understanding and ability to predict the impacts of propagating events and to ameliorate these impacts through proactive measures.},

  abstract = {Dendritic ecological networks (DENs) are a unique form of ecological networks that exhibit a dendritic network topology (e.g. stream and cave networks or plant architecture). DENs have a dual spatial representation; as points within the network and as points in geographical space. Consequently, some analytical methods used to quantify relationships in other types of ecological networks, or in 2-D space, may be inadequate for studying the influence of structure and connectivity on ecological processes within DENs. We propose a conceptual taxonomy of network analysis methods that account for DEN characteristics to varying degrees and provide a synthesis of the different approaches within the context of stream ecology. Within this context, we summarise the key innovations of a new family of spatial statistical models that describe spatial relationships in DENs. Finally, we discuss how different network analyses may be combined to address more complex and novel research questions. While our main focus is streams, the taxonomy of network analyses is also relevant anywhere spatial patterns in both network and 2-D space can be used to explore the influence of multi-scale processes on biota and their habitat (e.g. plant morphology and pest infestation, or preferential migration along stream or road corridors).},

To date, we have had restricted understanding of the benefits and risks that species redistribution may pose to individual countries, and a limited appreciation of the variability in current opportunities for developing effective monitoring approaches that build on existing national frameworks. To assess the present level of ecological, economic and societal risks and opportunities associated with new arrivals of species driven by changes in climatic conditions, we conducted a review of the available information on changes in animal species (both terrestrial and marine) distribution suspected to be linked to climate change in the United Kingdom over the past 10 years (2008\textendash{}2018). We found evidence that at least 55 species have arrived in new locations in the country due to climate change in the past decade, with 22 of them suspected to impact positively or negatively the recipient ecosystems, or nearby human communities. Ten of these 55 species were identified using keywords and hashtags on social media. Synthesis and applications. Our work identifies pressing monitoring gaps relevant to the management of species on the move and discusses the potential for social media to help address current information needs. It also calls for more theoretical work to enable the quick identification of species likely to be problematic (or beneficial) and locations likely to experience significant ecological and societal impacts from biodiversity's redistribution under a changing climate.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new way of measuring and optimizing connectivity in conservation landscapes through time, accounting for both the biological needs of multiple species and the social and financial constraint of minimizing land area requiring additional protection. Our method is based on the concept of network flow; we demonstrate its use by optimizing protected areas in the Western Cape of South Africa to facilitate autogenic species shifts in geographic range under climate change for a family of endemic plants, the Cape Proteaceae. In 2005, P. Williams and colleagues introduced a novel framework for this protected area design task. To ensure population viability, they assumed each species should have a range size of at least 100 km2 of predicted suitable conditions contained in protected areas at all times between 2000 and 2050. The goal was to design multiple dispersal corridors for each species, connecting suitable conditions between time periods, subject to each species' limited dispersal ability, and minimizing the total area requiring additional protection. We show that both minimum range size and limited dispersal abilities can be naturally modeled using the concept of network flow. This allows us to apply well-established tools from operations research and computer science for solving network flow problems. Using the same data and this novel modeling approach, we reduce the area requiring additional protection by a third compared to previous methods, from 4593 km2 to 3062 km2, while still achieving the same conservation planning goals. We prove that this is the best solution mathematically possible: the given planning goals cannot be achieved with a smaller area, given our modeling assumptions and data. Our method allows for flexibility and refinement of the underlying climate-change, species-habitat-suitability, and dispersal models. In particular, we propose an alternate formalization of a minimum range size moving through time and use network flow to achieve the revised goals, again with the smallest possible newly protected area (2850 km2). We show how to relate total dispersal distance to probability of successful dispersal, and compute a trade-off curve between this quantity and the total amount of extra land that must be protected.},

  abstract = {Most methods for modeling species distributions from occurrence records require additional data representing the range of environmental conditions in the modeled region. These data, called background or pseudo-absence data, are usually drawn at random from the entire region, whereas occurrence collection is often spatially biased toward easily accessed areas. Since the spatial bias generally results in environmental bias, the difference between occurrence collection and background sampling may lead to inaccurate models. To correct the estimation, we propose choosing background data with the same bias as occurrence data. We investigate theoretical and practical implications of this approach. Accurate information about spatial bias is usually lacking, so explicit biased sampling of background sites may not be possible. However, it is likely that an entire target group of species observed by similar methods will share similar bias. We therefore explore the use of all occurrences within a target group as biased background data. We compare model performance using target-group background and randomly sampled background on a comprehensive collection of data for 226 species from diverse regions of the world. We find that target-group background improves average performance for all the modeling methods we consider, with the choice of background data having as large an effect on predictive performance as the choice of modeling method. The performance improvement due to target-group background is greatest when there is strong bias in the target-group presence records. Our approach applies to regression-based modeling methods that have been adapted for use with occurrence data, such as generalized linear or additive models and boosted regression trees, and to Maxent, a probability density estimation method. We argue that increased awareness of the implications of spatial bias in surveys, and possible modeling remedies, will substantially improve predictions of species distributions.},

We do this by broadening the classic metapopulation patch-dynamic framework so that it can also account for trophic interactions between many species and patches. Unlike previous metacommunity models, we argue that this requires a system of equations to track the changing patch occupancy of the various species interactions, not the patch occupancy of individual species. We then suggest how this general theoretical framework can be used to study complex and spatially extended food web metacommunities.},

It has, however, been hampered so far by the difficulty to quantify variation among interaction networks. Here, we propose a general framework to study the dissimilarity of species interaction networks over time, space or environments, allowing both the use of quantitative and qualitative data. We decompose network dissimilarity into interactions and species turnover components, so that it is immediately comparable to common measures of b-diversity. We emphasise that scaling up b-diversity of community composition to the b-diversity of interactions requires only a small methodological step, which we foresee will help empiricists adopt this method. We illustrate the framework with a large dataset of hosts and parasites interactions and highlight other possible usages. We discuss a research agenda towards a biogeographical theory of species interactions.},

Its drivers in competitive systems (sampling effect and functional complementarity) are intuitive and elegant, but we lack an integrative understanding of these drivers in complex ecosystems. Because networks encompass two key components of the BEF relationship (species richness and biomass flow), they provide a key to identify these drivers, assuming that we have a meaningful measure of functional complementarity. In a network, diversity can be defined by species richness, the number of trophic levels, but perhaps more importantly, the diversity of interactions. In this paper, we define the concept of trophic complementarity (TC), which emerges through exploitative and apparent competition processes, and study its contribution to ecosystem functioning. Using a model of trophic community dynamics, we show that TC predicts various measures of ecosystem functioning, and generate a range of testable predictions. We find that, in addition to the number of species, the structure of their interactions needs to be accounted for to predict ecosystem productivity.},

Two major strands of ecology \textendash{} habitat modelling and community ecology \textendash{} approach this problem differently. Habitat modellers often use species distribution models (SDMs) to quantify the relationship between species' and their environments without considering potential biotic interactions. Community ecologists, on the other hand, tend to focus on biotic interactions and, in observational studies, use co-occurrence patterns to identify ecological processes. Here, we describe a joint species distribution model (JSDM) that integrates these distinct observational approaches by incorporating species co-occurrence data into a SDM.},

  abstract = {A central goal of comparative plant ecology is to understand how functional traits vary among species and to what extent this variation has adaptive value. Here we evaluate relationships between four functional traits (seed volume, specific leaf area, wood density, and adult stature) and two demographic attributes (diameter growth and tree mortality) for large trees of 240 tree species from five Neotropical forests. We evaluate how these key functional traits are related to survival and growth and whether similar relationships between traits and demography hold across different tropical forests. There was a tendency for a trade-off between growth and survival across rain forest tree species. Wood density, seed volume, and adult stature were significant predictors of growth and/or mortality. Both growth and mortality rates declined with an increase in wood density. This is consistent with greater construction costs and greater resistance to stem damage for denser wood. Growth and mortality rates also declined as seed volume increased. This is consistent with an adaptive syndrome in which species tolerant of low resource availability (in this case shade-tolerant species) have large seeds to establish successfully and low inherent growth and mortality rates. Growth increased and mortality decreased with an increase in adult stature, because taller species have a greater access to light and longer life spans. Specific leaf area was, surprisingly, only modestly informative for the performance of large trees and had ambiguous relationships with growth and survival. Single traits accounted for 9\textendash{}55\% of the interspecific variation in growth and mortality rates at individual sites. Significant correlations with demographic rates tended to be similar across forests and for phylogenetically independent contrasts as well as for cross-species analyses that treated each species as an independent observation. In combination, the morphological traits explained 41\% of the variation in growth rate and 54\% of the variation in mortality rate, with wood density being the best predictor of growth and mortality. Relationships between functional traits and demographic rates were statistically similar across a wide range of Neotropical forests. The consistency of these results strongly suggests that tropical rain forest species face similar trade-offs in different sites and converge on similar sets of solutions.},

These invasions have serious ecological and economic impacts. Human activities such as recreational boating are an important pathway for dispersal. Gravity models are used to quantify the dispersal effect of human activity. Gravity models currently used in ecology are deterministic. This paper proposes the use of stochastic gravity models in ecology, which provides new capabilities both in model building and in potential model applications. These models allow us to use standard statistical inference tools such as maximum likelihood estimation and model selection based on information criteria. To facilitate prediction, we use only those covariates that are easily available from common data sources and can be forecasted in future. This is important for forecasting the spread of invasive species in geographical and temporal domain. The proposed model is portable, that is it can be used for estimating relative boater traffic and hence relative propagule pressure for the lakes not covered by current boater surveys. This makes our results broadly applicable to various invasion prediction and management models.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity conveys numerous functional benefits to forested ecosystems, including community stability and resilience. In the context of managing forests for climate change mitigation/adaptation, maximizing and/or maintaining aboveground biomass will require understanding the interactions between tree biodiversity, site productivity, and the stocking of live trees. Species richness may not be the most appropriate tree biodiversity metric in this context as it weights all species as equally important. Measures that account for evolutionary relationships among species should be more biologically meaningful surrogates of functional diversity within forest communities, given that more phylogenetically distinct species should contribute more to the diversity of traits within a community. Using data from approximately 79,000 permanent and standardized forest inventory plots across the United States, we assessed trends in live aboveground tree biomass (LAGB) in relation to metrics of forest tree biodiversity at national and regional scales, controlling for site productivity and live tree stocking. These metrics included four measures of evolutionary diversity associated with distinct components of functional variation. In certain situations and locations across the U.S., evolutionary diversity metrics supply additional information about forest stands beyond that provided by simple species richness counts. This information can potentially include critical insight into tree functional attributes inherently related to evolutionary diversity. Relationships nationally between LAGB and most biodiversity metrics weakened with increasing site productivity and with increasing live tree stocking: The greater the site productivity and tree stocking, the less likely that higher biodiversity was associated with greater LAGB. This is consistent with the expectation that the coexistence of functionally different species increases forest productivity in less productive and more stressful environments, while dominant and highly productive species are able to competitively dominate in more productive habitats. Phylogenetic species clustering (PSC) was increasingly correlated with LAGB as live tree stocking increased on low-productivity sites, suggesting that the co-occurrence of tree species more widely distributed across the phylogenetic tree of life, and therefore likely possessing a wider variety of functional attributes, resulted in greater biomass accumulation on poorer sites. PSC and species richness appear to be the best biodiversity predictors for LAGB on the low-productivity sites likely to be most important for carbon/biomass management. These biodiversity metrics will be important for maximizing biomass/carbon for future carbon sequestration or bioenergy needs and should serve as indicators of forest function in forest resource assessments.},

Warming since the 1850s, increases in annual mean temperature of at least 2 \textdegree{}C between 2000 and 2050 are highly probable. Annual mean temperatures across the Canadian boreal zone could be 4\textendash{}5 \textdegree{}C warmer than today's by 2100. All aspects of boreal forest ecosystem function are likely to be affected. Further, several potential ``tipping elements'' \textemdash{} where exposure to increasing changes in climate may trigger distinct shifts in ecosystem state \textemdash{} can be identified across the Canadian boreal zone. Approximately 40\% of the forested area is underlain by permafrost, some of which is already degrading irreversibly, triggering a process of forest decline and re-establishment lasting several decades, while also releasing significant quantities of greenhouse gases that will amplify the future global warming trend. Warmer temperatures coupled with significant changes in the distribution and timing of annual precipitation are likely to cause serious tree-killing droughts in the west; east of the Great Lakes, however, where precipitation is generally nonlimiting, warming coupled with increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide may stimulate higher forest productivity. Large wildfires, which can cause serious economic losses, are expected to become more frequent, but increases in mean annual area burned will be relatively gradual. The most immediate threats could come from endemic forest insect pests that have the potential for population outbreaks in response to relatively small temperature increases. Quantifying the multiple effects of climate change will be challenging, particularly because there are great uncertainties attached to possible interactions among them, as well as with other land-use pressures. Considerable ingenuity will be needed from forest managers and scientists to address the formidable challenges posed by climate change to boreal ecosystems and develop effective strategies to adapt sustainable forest management practices to the impending changes.},

Monthly data for the period 1961\textendash{}2100 were downloaded mainly from the web portal of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (Phase 3) of the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison, and subsets of data covering North America were extracted. Scenario data sets were produced for monthly mean daily maximum and minimum temperatures, precipitation, solar radiation, wind speed, and vapor pressure. All variables were expressed as changes relative to the simulated monthly means for 1961\textendash{}1990, which corrected for GCM bias in reproducing past climate and allowed future projected trends to be compared directly. The downscaling procedure used the ANUSPLIN software package to fit a two-dimensional spline function to each month's change data for each climate variable at a spatial resolution of 5 arcminutes (0.0833\textordmasculine{}) longitude and latitude. The resulting scenarios were surprisingly consistent, with differences resulting from different GHG forcings being generally greater than those resulting from different GCMs, although the consistency varied spatially. The A2 emissions scenario invariably generated the greatest warming by 2100, and the B1 scenario the least. Canada's far north was projected to undergo the greatest regional increases in temperature and precipitation, and the southeast and west coastal regions the least, with intermediate warming in midcontinental regions. All models projected increases in precipitation that were generally correlated with the projected increases in temperature, although with greater differences in spatial and seasonal patterns. Changes in vapor pressure were similarly correlated with changes in temperature and precipitation, whereas solar radiation was projected to decline slightly in regions where the increase in precipitation was particularly pronounced. Gridded data sets will be made available as a resource to researchers and others needing high-resolution data for studies of the impacts of climate change. A companion report and data set will be issued by the US Department of Agriculture Forest Service for the continental United States and Alaska.},

For technical reasons, comparing large networks is computationally infeasible, and thus heuristics, such as the degree distribution, clustering coefficient, diameter, and relative graphlet frequency distribution have been sought. It is easy to demonstrate that two networks are different by simply showing a short list of properties in which they differ. It is much harder to show that two networks are similar, as it requires demonstrating their similarity in all of their exponentially many properties. Clearly, it is computationally prohibitive to analyze all network properties, but the larger the number of constraints we impose in determining network similarity, the more likely it is that the networks will truly be similar.},

In particular, I show that Hutchinson's niche concept can be modified to incorporate the influences of niche width, habitat availability and dispersal, as well as interspecific competition per se. I introduce a simulation model called NICHE that embodies many of Hutchinson's original niche concepts and use this model to predict patterns of species distribution. The model may help to clarify how dispersal, niche size and competition interact, and under what conditions species might be common in unsuitable habitat or absent from suitable habitat. A brief review of the pertinent literature suggests that species are often absent from suitable habitat and present in unsuitable habitat, in ways predicted by theory. However, most tests of niche theory are hampered by inadequate consideration of what does and does not constitute suitable habitat. More conclusive evidence for these predictions will require rigorous determination of habitat suitability under field conditions. I suggest that to do this, ecologists must measure habitat specific demography and quantify how demographic parameters vary in response to temporal and spatial variation in measurable niche dimensions.},

  abstract = {BackgroundCanopy structure, which can be defined as the sum of the sizes, shapes and relative placements of the tree crowns in a forest stand, is central to all aspects of forest ecology. But there is no accepted method for deriving canopy structure from the sizes, species and biomechanical properties of the individual trees in a stand. Any such method must capture the fact that trees are highly plastic in their growth, forming tessellating crown shapes that fill all or most of the canopy space.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe introduce a new, simple and rapidly-implemented model\textendash{}the Ideal Tree Distribution, ITD\textendash{}with tree form (height allometry and crown shape), growth plasticity, and space-filling, at its core. The ITD predicts the canopy status (in or out of canopy), crown depth, and total and exposed crown area of the trees in a stand, given their species, sizes and potential crown shapes. We use maximum likelihood methods, in conjunction with data from over 100,000 trees taken from forests across the coterminous US, to estimate ITD model parameters for 250 North American tree species. With only two free parameters per species\textendash{}one aggregate parameter to describe crown shape, and one parameter to set the so-called depth bias\textendash{}the model captures between-species patterns in average canopy status, crown radius, and crown depth, and within-species means of these metrics vs stem diameter. The model also predicts much of the variation in these metrics for a tree of a given species and size, resulting solely from deterministic responses to variation in stand structure.Conclusions/SignificanceThis new model, with parameters for US tree species, opens up new possibilities for understanding and modeling forest dynamics at local and regional scales, and may provide a new way to interpret remote sensing data of forest canopies, including LIDAR and aerial photography.},

Climate warming is expected to induce movement of species upslope and towards higher latitudes. However, the mechanisms and physiological processes behind the altitudinal and latitudinal distribution range of a tree species are complex and depend on each tree species features and vary over ontogenetic stages. We investigated the altitudinal distribution differences between juvenile and adult individuals of seven major European tree species along elevational transects covering a wide latitudinal range from southern Spain (37\textdegree{}N) to northern Sweden (67\textdegree{}N). By comparing juvenile and adult distributions (shifts on the optimum position and the range limits) we assessed the response of species to present climate conditions in relation to previous conditions that prevailed when adults were established. Mean temperature increased by 0.86 \textdegree{}C on average at our sites during the last decade compared with previous 30-year period. Only one of the species studied, Abies alba, matched the expected predictions under the observed warming, with a maximum abundance of juveniles at higher altitudes than adults. Three species, Fagus sylvatica, Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris, showed an opposite pattern while for other three species, such as Quercus ilex, Acer pseudoplatanus and Q. petraea, we were no able to detect changes in distribution. These findings are in contrast with theoretical predictions and show that tree responses to climate change are complex and are obscured not only by other environmental factors but also by internal processes related to ontogeny and demography.},

The main driver behind this is an awareness that biodiversity loss operates at large spatial scales and generally involves reductions and changes in species at different trophic levels simultaneously. Evaluating how ecosystem processes are likely to change following species loss at multiple trophic levels will be difficult because of the feedbacks between levels and between levels and the ecosystem processes of interest. Similarly, carrying out manipulative experiments designed to accommodate multiple trophic levels at the landscape scales in which society is interested will be extremely challenging. Novel approaches, such as the BioMERGE (Biotic Mechanisms of Ecosystem Regulation in the Global Environment) initiative, are needed. In addition, future work should be more services-oriented, rather than process-oriented, if effects of biodiversity change on services are to be properly assessed. Finally, the application of mainstream ecosystem ecology to biodiversity\textendash{}ecosystem functioning research seems to have been neglected to date. In this respect, there is potential for the mass-balance approach to contribute to the debate.},

Succession and disturbance alter, however, habitat quality and quantity through time especially under global climate and land use change scenarios; hence, static protected areas may not ensure habitat persistence and species survival. Here, we examined the relative merits of static and dynamic (floating) protected areas for the conservation of American marten (Martes americana) habitat in a dynamic boreal forest of Que\textasciiacute{} bec (Canada). Forest dynamics were modeled using a spatially-explicit landscape disturbance model and protected areas were selected based on the quality and compactness of marten home ranges using MARXAN. Static protected areas were fixed in space during 200 year simulations of boreal forest dynamics, while dynamic protected areas were re-located every 50 years to track dynamic habitat. Dynamic protected areas supported more high quality home ranges through time than static protected areas. The locations of dynamic protected areas were constrained, however, by the highly fragmented forest patterns created through logging and fire in unprotected areas. Our findings emphasize the often-overlooked point that if dynamic conservation planning is to be successful in the long term, the landscape matrix quality surrounding protected areas must be managed in such a way that options remain when it comes to re-planning.},

There has been an explosive proliferation of network (connectivity) measures, resulting in over 60 measures for ecologists to now choose from. Conceptual clarification on the ecological meaning of these network measures and their interrelationships is overdue. We present a framework that categorizes network measures based on the connectivity property that they quantify (i.e., route-specific flux, route redundancy, route vulnerability, and connected habitat area) and the structural level of the habitat network to which they apply. The framework reveals a lack of network measures in the categories of ``route-specific flux among neighboring habitat patches'' and ``route redundancy at the level of network components.'' We propose that network motif and path redundancy measures can be developed to fill the gaps in these categories. The value of this framework lies in its ability to inform the selection and application of network measures. Ultimately, it will allow a better comparison among graph, network, and circuit analyses, which will improve the design and management of connected landscapes.},

Despite their importance, however, ecological interactions have not yet been explicitly incorporated into conservation prioritization methods. We develop here a general method for incorporating consumer\textendash{}resource interactions into spatial reserve design. This method protects spatial consumer\textendash{}resource interactions by protecting areas that maintain the connectivity between the distribution of consumers and resources. We illustrate our method with a conservation planning case study of a mammalian predator, American marten (Martes americana), and its two primary prey species, Redbacked vole (Clethrionomys rutilus) and Deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus). The conservation goal was to identify a reserve for marten that comprised 12\% of a forest management unit in the boreal forest in Qu{\'e}bec, Canada. We compared reserves developed using analysis variants that utilized different levels of information about predator and prey habitat distributions, species-specific connectivity requirements, and interaction connectivity requirements. The inclusion of consumer\textendash{}resource interactions in reserveselection resulted in spatially aggregated reserves that maintained local habitat quality for the species. This spatial aggregation was not induced by applying a qualitative penalty for the boundary length of the reserve, but rather was a direct consequence of modelling the spatial needs of the interacting consumer and resources. Our method for maintaining connectivity between consumers and their resources within reserves can be applied even under the most extreme cases of either complete spatial overlap or complete spatial segregation of consumer\textendash{}resource distributions. The method has been made available via public software.},

Extensive reviews of the literature and manipulative experiments suggest that mangroves will be impacted by climate change, but few studies have tested these predictions over large scales using statistical models. We provide the first example of applying species and community distribution models (SDMs and CDMs, respectively) to coastal mangroves worldwide. Species distributions were modeled as ensemble forecasts using BIOMOD. Distributions of mangrove communities with high species richness were modeled in three ways: as the sum of the separate SDM outputs, as binary hotspots (with .3 species) using a generalized linear model, and continuously using a general boosted model. Individual SDMs were projected for 12 species with sufficient data and CDMs were projected for 30 species into 2080 using global climate model outputs and a range of sea-level rise projections. Species projected to shift their ranges polewards by at least 2 degrees of latitude consistently experience a decrease in the amount of suitable coastal area available to them. Central America and the Caribbean are forecast to lose more mangrove species than other parts of the world. We found that the extent and grain size, at which continuous CDM outputs are examined, independent of the grain size at which the models operate, can dramatically influence the number of pseudo-absences needed for optimal parameterization. The SDMs and CDMs presented here provide a first approximation of how mangroves will respond to climate change given simple correlative relationships between occurrence records and environmental data. Additional, precise georeferenced data on mangrove localities and concerted efforts to collect data on ecological processes across large-scale climatic gradients will enable future research to improve upon these correlative models.},

Our frameworks are based on conditional autoregressive simulations to derive empirical distributions for each metric where composition and configuration parameters are controlled. Our method permits the computation of probabilities that an observed metric value is either greater than or less than a given level of expectation. We also provide means for situating any landscape on a selected pattern metricsurface defined by parameters of composition and configuration. These surfaces illustrate which parameter would be most easily adjusted to effect a desired change in a selected class-focused pattern metric's value.

Scenario analysis was conducted using a variety of assumptions concerning biotic and abiotic interactions, and under the A2 climate scenario all model scenarios predict a decline of moose density at the southern limits of the Ontario distribution and an increase at the northern extents. Predicted declines are a result of lower carrying capacity and higher heat stress, parasite loads and wolf predation. Given the sensitivity of the model to density-dependent factors, the indirect effect of parasites on decreased recruitment may have greater impact on moose than the direct effect of increased death rate. Results indicate that conservation planning for woodland caribou populations should account for possible increases in moose and wolf populations.},

  abstract = {Aim Climate change will alter the geographic distribution of many species, but in forest communities, long-lived trees often persist after the climate is no longer suitable for recruitment. Disturbance events may accelerate distribution shifts in forested ecosystems by removing persistent trees and creating new recruitment opportunities for species better adapted to the current climate. Here, we investigate how biological disturbances such as insect outbreaks may interact with climate change to initiate tree species range shifts. Location Southern Rocky Mountains, Colorado, USA. Methods We compared tree and seedling data from long-term monitoring transects established in 1992\textendash{}1995 and re-sampled in 2012 following a widespread mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) outbreak. Transects are located along elevational gradients at the altitudinal range margins of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta). Results We found that recruitment had declined through time at the trailing edge of lodgepole pine's distribution (lower elevation range margin), where there are now many fewer seedlings compared to the leading edge (upper elevation range margin). At the trailing edge, mountain pine beetle increased mortality of mature lodgepole pines relative to background levels. This mortality was associated with an increase in recruitment of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), a lower elevation tree species. At the leading edge of lodgepole pine's distribution, overstorey mortality was associated with only a modest increase in the density of lodgepole pine seedlings (mean increase of 362 seedlings{$\cdot$}ha-1), and instead favoured more shade-tolerant competitors (mean increase of 2182 seedlings{$\cdot$}ha-1). Conclusion While there is some evidence that climate change is beginning to alter the altitudinal range of lodgepole pine, mountain pine beetle disturbance will likely facilitate this process only at the trailing (lower elevation) range margin. At the leading (upper elevation) range margin, range expansion may be limited by competition with trees and seedlings of species not susceptible to mountain pine beetle. A physical disturbance such as fire that can eliminate competing species may be required for the upward expansion of lodgepole pine's leading range margin. For tree species such as lodgepole pine that are affected by periodic insect outbreaks, ranges may shrink in the near term if this disturbance\textendash{}climate interaction continues to drive range retractions that outpace range expansions.},

  abstract = {Recent studies projecting future climate change impacts on forests mainly consider either the effects of climate change on productivity or on disturbances. However, productivity and disturbances are intrinsically linked because 1) disturbances directly affect forest productivity (e.g. via a reduction in leaf area, growing stock or resource-use efficiency), and 2) disturbance susceptibility is often coupled to a certain development phase of the forest with productivity determining the time a forest is in this specific phase of susceptibility. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of forest productivity changes in different forest regions in Europe under climate change, and partition these changes into effects induced by climate change alone and by climate change and disturbances. We present projections of climate change impacts on forest productivity from state-of-the-art forest models that dynamically simulate forest productivity and the effects of the main European disturbance agents (fire, storm, insects), driven by the same climate scenario in seven forest case studies along a large climatic gradient throughout Europe. Our study shows that, in most cases, including disturbances in the simulations exaggerate ongoing productivity declines or cancel out productivity gains in response to climate change. In fewer cases, disturbances also increase productivity or buffer climate-change induced productivity losses, e.g. because low severity fires can alleviate resource competition and increase fertilization. Even though our results cannot simply be extrapolated to other types of forests and disturbances, we argue that it is necessary to interpret climate change-induced productivity and disturbance changes jointly to capture the full range of climate change impacts on forests and to plan adaptation measures.},

Canopy damage was assessed using visual damage classes within watersheds of different ages at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) and changes in leaf area index in two of these watersheds. Ice thickness was measured, and ice loads of trees were estimated using regression equations. In the 60- to 120-year-old forests (mean basal area 26 m2{$\cdot$}ha\textendash{}1), damage was greatest in trees {$>$}30 cm diameter at breast height and at elevations above 600 m. Of the dominant tree species, beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) was the most damaged, sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) was the most resistant, and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.) was intermediate. Trees with advanced beech bark disease experienced heavier ice damage. Little damage occurred in the 14-year-old forest, while the 24- to 28-year-old forest experienced intense damage. In the young stands of this forest, damage was greatest between 600 and 750 m, in trees on steep slopes and near streams, and among pin cherry (Prunus pensylvanica L.). Recovery of the canopy was tracked over three growing seasons, and root growth was monitored 1 year after the storm. Because of the high density of advance regeneration from beech bark disease and root sprouting potential in ice-damaged beech, HBEF will likely see an increase in beech abundance in older forests as a result of the storm. There will also be a more rapid change from pioneer species to mature northern hardwoods in the younger forests. These predictions illustrate the ability of rare disturbances to increase heterogeneity of forest structure and composition in this ecosystem, especially through interactions with other disturbances.},

Traditional presence/absence coefficients are usually based on different combinations of the matching/mismatching components of the 2~?~2 contingency table. However, more recently, dissimilarity measures that incorporate information about the degree of functional differences between the species in both plots have received increasing attention. This is because such ?functional dissimilarity measures? capture information on the species' functional traits, which is ignored by traditional coefficients. Therefore, functional dissimilarity measures tend to correlate more strongly with ecosystem?level processes, as species influence these processes via their traits. In this study, we introduce a new family of dissimilarity measures for presence and absence data, which consider functional dissimilarities among species in the calculation of the matching/mismatching components of the 2~?~2 contingency table. Within this family, the behavior of the Jaccard coefficient, together with its additive components, species replacement, and richness difference, is examined by graphical comparisons and ordinations based on simulated data.},

  abstract = {Ecologists have traditionally viewed {$\beta$}-diversity as the ratio between {$\gamma$}-diversity and average {$\alpha$}-diversity. More recently, an alternative way of partitioning diversity has been proposed for which {$\beta$}-diversity is obtained as the difference between {$\gamma$}-diversity and average {$\alpha$}-diversity. Although this additive model of diversity decomposition is generally considered superior to its multiplicative counterpart, in both models {$\beta$}-diversity is a formally derived quantity without any self-contained ecological meaning; it simply quantifies the diversity excess of {$\gamma$}-diversity with respect to average {$\alpha$}-diversity. Taking this excess as an index of {$\beta$}-diversity is a questionable operation. In this paper, we show that a particular family of {$\alpha$}-diversity measures, the most celebrated of which is Rao's quadratic entropy, can be adequately used for summarizing {$\beta$}-diversity. Our proposal naturally leads to a new additive model of diversity for which, given two or more sets of plots, overall plot-to-plot species variability can be additively partitioned into two non-negative components: average variability in species composition within each set of plots and the species variability between the set of plots. For conservation purposes, the suggested change of perspective in the summarization of {$\beta$}-diversity allows for a flexible analysis of spatial heterogeneity in ecological diversity so that different hierarchical levels of biotic relevance (i.e. from the genetic to the landscape level) can be expressed in a significant and consistent way.},

  abstract = {1. Riverscapes consist of the main channel and lateral slackwater habitats along a gradient of hydrological connectivity from maximum connection in main channel habitats to minimum connection in backwaters. Spatiotemporal differences in water currents along this gradient produce dynamic habitat conditions that influence species diversity, population densities and trophic interactions of fishes. 2. We examined the importance of lateral connectivity gradients for food web dynamics in the Upper Mississippi River during spring (high flow, moderately low temperatures) and summer (low flow, higher temperatures). We used literature information and gut contents analyses to determine feeding guilds and stable isotope analysis to estimate mean trophic position of local fish assemblages. During June and August 2006, we collected over 1000 tissue samples from four habitats (main channel, secondary channels, tertiary channels and backwaters) distributed within four hydrologic connectivity gradients. 3. Mean trophic position differed among feeding guilds and seasons, with highest values in spring. Mean trophic position of fish assemblages, variability in trophic position and food chain length (maximum trophic position) of the two dominant piscivore species (Micropterus salmoides and M. dolomieu) in both seasons were significantly associated with habitat along the lateral connectivity gradient. Food chain length peaked in tertiary channels in both seasons, probably due to higher species diversity of prey at these habitats. We infer that food chain length and trophic position of fish assemblages were lower in backwater habitats in the summer mainly because of the use of alternative food sources in these habitats. 4. A greater number of conspecifics exhibited significant among-habitat variation in trophic position during the summer, indicating that low river stages can constrain fish movements in the Upper Mississippi River. 5. Results of this study should provide a better understanding of the fundamental structure of large river ecosystems and an improved basis for river rehabilitation and management through knowledge of the importance of lateral complexity in rivers.},

Despite the importance for science and management communities, our ability to forecast tree mortality at landscape to continental scales is limited. However, two independent information streams have the potential to inform and improve mortality forecasts: repeat forest inventories and satellite remote sensing. Time series of tree-level growth patterns indicate that productivity declines and related temporal dynamics often precede mortality years to decades before death. Plot-level productivity, in turn, has been related to satellite-based indices such as the Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Here we link these two data sources to show that early warning signals of mortality are evident in several NDVI-based metrics up to 24 years before death. We focus on two repeat forest inventories and three NDVI products across western boreal North America where productivity and mortality dynamics are influenced by periodic drought. These data sources capture a range of forest conditions and spatial resolution to highlight the sensitivity and limitations of our approach. Overall, results indicate potential to use satellite NDVI for early warning signals of mortality. Relationships are broadly consistent across inventories, species, and spatial resolutions, although the utility of coarse-scale imagery in the heterogeneous aspen parkland was limited. Longer-term NDVI data and annually remeasured sites with high mortality levels generate the strongest signals, although we still found robust relationships at sites remeasured at a typical 5 year frequency. The approach and relationships developed here can be used as a basis for improving forest mortality models and monitoring systems.},

  abstract = {In Canada, as in other large forested countries of the world, managers and scientists alike question what can happen to forest biodiversity under long-term industrial forest management. Recent studies may help us understand how species react when habitat is lost past a certain threshold in the landscape. In the case of population, a ``critical threshold for habitat'' does exist in forested habitat, which is defined by the minimal proportion of habitat needed to be preserved to avoid drastic population declines or massive species loss. In this paper, two types of thresholds are described, the first refers to population, and the second refers to the community of species. Many ecologists agree with the assumption that the specialist, sensitive species are the first to disappear (local extirpation for specialist species). For most species with large home range (such as birds), the threshold may generally be located between 30\% and 40\% of the habitat still remaining, compared to the proportion observed under a natural disturbance regime. We suggest, in order to protect the most sensitive species and to deal with uncertainty associated with thresholds, to maintain at least 40\% of residual habitats. Although there is still much to understand concerning these thresholds, we nevertheless recommend their use for the diagnostic analysis that must be performed in the context of forest management planning and biodiversity conservation, as these thresholds could represent the minimal proportion of habitat to preserve integrity of the forest ecosystem. However, to be effective, the application of thresholds should be based on detailed knowledge of ecosystem characteristics and dynamics.},

Empirical patterns in food webs have consistently shown that the distributions of species and interactions in nature are more likely to be stable than randomly constructed systems with the same number of species and interactions. Food web ecology still faces two fundamental challenges, however. First, the quantity and quality of food web data required to document both the species richness and the interaction strengths among all species within food webs is largely prohibitive. Second, where food webs have been well documented, spatial and temporal variation in food web structure has been ignored. Conversely, research that has addressed spatial and temporal variation in ecosystems has generally ignored the full complexity of food web architecture. Here, we incorporate empirical patterns, largely from macroecology and behavioural ecology, into a spatially implicit food web structure to construct a simple landscape theory of food web architecture. Such an approach both captures important architectural features of food webs and allows for an exploration of food web structure across a range of spatial scales. Finally, we demonstrated that food webs are hierarchically organized along the spatial and temporal niche axes of species and their utilization of food resources in ways that stabilize ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The conservation of ecosystems focuses on evaluating individual sites or landscapes based on their component species. To produce a map of conservation values, we developed a method to weight habitat-suitability maps for individual species by species-specific extinction risks. The value of a particular site reflects the importance and magnitude of the threats facing the component species of the ecological community. We applied this approach to a set of species from the California Gap Analysis Project. The resulting map of multispecies conservation values identified the areas with the best habitat for the species most vulnerable to extinction. These methods are flexible and can accommodate the quantity and quality of data available for each individual species in both the development of the habitat-suitability maps and the estimation of the extinction risks. Additionally, the multispecies conservation value can accommodate specific conservation goals, such as preservation of local endemics, making it useful for prioritizing conservation and management actions. This approach provides an estimate of the ecological worth of a site based on habitat characteristics and quantitative models in terms of all the ecological components of a site, rather than a single threatened or endangered species.},

  abstract = {This study explores the implications of spatial scale for conservation planning in the Agulhas Plain, South Africa. Regional planning relies on broad-scale data but fine-scale data are usually required for implementation at local level. This study addresses the implications of broad-scale planning for fine-scale implementation. Two original systems of notional reserves were developed for this region using C-plan, a decision support system for systematic conservation planning. The first conservation plan was derived using broad scale data (1:250,000) and consisted of nine broad habitat units (land classes based on topography, geology, and climate), remote sensing mapping of habitat transformation and large planning units defined by 1/16th degree squares (average size 3900 ha). The second system was identified at a finer scale (1:10,000) using 36 vegetation types (mapped in the field), ground survey mapping of habitat transformation and cadastral boundaries as planning units (average size 252 ha). Using classification trees, this study compared reserve-design efficiency (the area required to achieve conservation targets), the spatial patterns of conservation value (the irreplaceability value of planning units), biodiversity features, and habitat transformation at both scales. A similar amount of land was required to meet all conservation targets (identified using minimum set analysis) at the broad and fine scale. There was considerable overlap between the two conservation plans as most of fine-scale conservation targets could be achieved under the broad-scale conservation plan. However, irreplaceability values, which measure the likelihood of selecting planning units for achieving representation targets, were much higher at the fine scale. The use of broad-scale biodiversity features underestimated irreplaceability value at a fine scale in heterogeneous and fragmented portions of the landscape. The implications of moving from broad- to fine-scale conservation planning, as well as their respective benefits are discussed. Maximising biodiversity conservation while minimising cost and resources might be achieved by a combination of broad-scale assessments for relatively homogeneous and untransformed areas and fine-scale ones for heterogeneous and fragmented areas.},

However, this `fingerprint' of climate change is yet to be assessed for an entire flora. Here, we examine patterns of altitudinal range change in the complete native vascular flora of sub-Antarctic Marion Island. We demonstrate a rapid mean upslope expansion in the flora since 1966, in response to 1.2 \textdegree{}C warming on the island. The 3.4{$\pm$}0.8 m yr-1 (mean{$\pm$}SE) upslope expansion rate documented is amongst the highest estimates from partial floras. However, less than half of the species in the flora were responsible for the expansion trend, demonstrating that the global fingerprint of warming may be driven by a highly responsive subset of the species pool. Individual range expansion rates varied greatly, with species-specific niche requirements explaining some of this variation. As a result of the idiosyncratic expansion rates, altitudinal patterns of species richness and community composition changed considerably, with the formation of no-analog communities at high and intermediate altitudes. Therefore, both species- and community-level changes have occurred in the flora of Marion Island over a relatively short period of rapid warming, demonstrating the sensitivity of high latitude communities to climate change. Patterns of change within this flora illustrate the range of variation in species responses to climate change and the consequences thereof for species distributions and community reorganization.},

Nat. 160, 173\textendash{}185] presented a unifying framework for the classic Levins metapopulation model by incorporating several realistic biological processes, such as the Allee effect, the Rescue effect and the Anti-rescue effect, via appropriate modifications of the two basic functions of colonization and extinction rates. Here we embed these model extensions on a spatially explicit framework. We consider population dynamics on a regular grid, each site of which represents a patch that is either occupied or empty, and with spatial coupling by neighborhood dispersal. While broad qualitative similarities exist between the spatially explicit models and their spatially implicit (mean-field) counterparts, there are also important differences that result from the details of local processes. Because of localized dispersal, spatial correlation develops among the dynamics of neighboring populations that decays with distance between patches. The extent of this correlation at equilibrium differs among the metapopulation types, depending on which processes prevail in the colonization and extinction dynamics. These differences among dynamical processes become manifest in the spatial pattern and distribution of ``clusters'' of occupied patches. Moreover, metapopulation dynamics along a smooth gradient of habitat availability show significant differences in the spatial pattern at the range limit. The relevance of these results to the dynamics of disease spread in metapopulations is discussed.},

We related these growth characteristics to multiple functional traits (wood density, adult stature, seed mass, leaf traits) in a hierarchical Bayesian model that accounted for measurement error and intraspecific variability of functional traits. Wood density was the most important trait determining all three growth characteristics. Intrinsic growth rates were additionally strongly related to adult stature, while all traits contributed to light response. Our analysis yielded a predictive model that allows estimation of growth characteristics for rare species on the basis of a few easily measurable morphological traits.},

However, the effects of diversity on demographic responses to the environment are poorly understood. We tested the diversity hypothesis (measured through functional diversity) and the mass ratio hypothesis (measured through functional identity) in relation to tree growth, tree mortality and sapling abundance. We sought to determine whether functional diversity underlies demographic responses to environmental variation in European forests. Location Europe (Spain, Germany, Wallonia, Finland and Sweden). Methods We used data from five European national forest inventories from boreal to Mediterranean biomes (c. 700,000 trees in 54,000 plots and 143 tree species) and the main forest types across Europe (i.e. from needle-leaved evergreen forests to broad-leaved deciduous forests). For each forest type, we applied maximum likelihood techniques to quantify the relative importance of stand structure, climate and diversity (i.e. functional diversity and functional identity) as determinants of growth, mortality and sapling abundance. We also tested whether demographic responses to environmental conditions (including stand density, evapotranspiration and temperature anomalies) varied with functional diversity. Results Our results suggest that functional diversity has a positive effect on sapling abundance and growth rates in forests across Europe, while no effect was observed on tree mortality. Functional identity has a strong effect on mortality and sapling abundance, with greater mortality rates in forests dominated by needle-leaved individuals and a greater abundance of saplings in forests dominated by broad-leaved individuals. Furthermore, we observed that functional diversity modified the effects of stand density on demographic responses in Mediterranean forests and the influence of evapotranspiration and temperature anomalies in forests widely distributed across Europe. Main conclusion Our results suggest that functional diversity may play a key role in forest dynamics through complementarity mechanisms, as well as by modulating demographic responses to environmental variation.},

We suggest that this is because empirical researchers do not design their studies to test specific hypotheses arising from the theoretical literature. In fact, theoretical work is almost completely ignored by empirical researchers, perhaps because it may be inaccessible to them. The purpose of this paper is to review theoretical work on the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on predator\textendash{}prey interactions. We provide a summary of clear, testable theoretical predictions for empirical researchers. To test one or more of these predictions, an empiricist will need certain information on the predator and prey species of interest. This includes: (1) whether the predator is a specialist on one prey species or feeds on many kinds of prey (omnivore and generalist); (2) whether the predator is restricted to the same habitat type as the focal prey (specialist), can use a variety of habitats but has higher survival in the prey habitat (omnivore), or lives primarily outside of the focal prey's habitat (generalist); (3) whether prey-only patches have lower prey extinction rates than predator\textendash{}prey patches; and (4) whether the prey emigrate at higher rates from predator\textendash{}prey patches than from prey-only patches. Empiricists also need to be clear on whether they are testing a prediction about habitat loss or habitat fragmentation and need to conduct empirical studies at spatial scales appropriate for testing the theoretical prediction(s). We suggest that appropriate use of the theoretical predictions in future empirical research will resolve the apparent inconsistencies in the empirical literature on this topic.},

However, it remains unclear whether this holds at the scales relevant for management, and particularly large knowledge gaps exist for temperate forests and for taxa other than trees. We built a comprehensive dataset of Central European temperate forest structure and multi-taxonomic diversity (beetles, birds, bryophytes, fungi, lichens, and plants) across 352 plots. We used Boosted Regression Trees (BRTs) to assess the relationship between above-ground live carbon stocks and (a) taxon-specific richness, (b) a unified multidiversity index. We used Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis to explore individual species' responses to changing above-ground carbon stocks and to detect change-points in species composition along the carbon-stock gradient. Our results reveal an overall weak and highly variable relationship between richness and carbon stock at the stand scale, both for individual taxonomic groups and for multidiversity. Similarly, the proportion of win-win and trade-off species (i.e., species favored or disadvantaged by increasing carbon stock, respectively) varied substantially across taxa. Win-win species gradually replaced trade-off species with increasing carbon, without clear thresholds along the above-ground carbon gradient, suggesting that community-level surrogates (e.g., richness) might fail to detect critical changes in biodiversity. Collectively, our analyses highlight that leveraging co-benefits between carbon and biodiversity in temperate forest may require stand-scale management that prioritizes either biodiversity or carbon in order to maximize co-benefits at broader scales. Importantly, this contrasts with tropical forests, where climate and biodiversity objectives can be integrated at the stand scale, thus highlighting the need for context-specificity when managing for multiple objectives. Accounting for critical change-points of target taxa can help to deal with this specificity, by defining a safe operating space to manipulate carbon while avoiding biodiversity losses.},

  abstract = {Population viability analysis (PVA) has become a widely used set of tools for evaluating relative extinction risk and prioritizing management options among imperiled populations. While PVA is a widely sanctioned tool in conservation biology, the field of population viability is in its infancy with respect to species interactions. In this paper, I review available methods for evaluating extinction risk when species interactions contribute significantly to population viability. This review includes an evaluation of six broad categories of species interactions (predation, disease, competition, mutualism, parasitism and hostparasitoid interactions) in population viability analysis, with a particular focus on predation as a case study. I first evaluated how often species interactions are considered when PVA is applied to population data from imperiled species. I identified 378 articles in commonly cited conservation journals, of which 24 attempted a viability analysis for populations threatened by interactions with other species. Most of these PVA's treat a putative species interaction as a constant source of mortality rather than a coupled, dynamic population process. Second, I reviewed the literature to identify the availability of time-series of abundance data for two interacting species in which at least one species was threatened or endangered. Adequate time-series data were available for both species comprising an interacting pair in only 9 out of 407 papers reviewed. Third, I used a stochastic, fully stage-structured predator prey model to create time-series data (vital rates and projection matrices) in order to quantify the efficacy of two matrix-based, single-species PVA approaches. Simple single-species PVAs confound stochastic variation with population cycles induced by species interactions (in this case predation). As a result these models provide conservatively biased forecasts of viability. Unfortunately, the data needed to construct more complex PVA's with feedback and multi-species stochasticity are rarely collected. I close with a discussion of key advances needed to ``escape the population vacuum'' in a move toward more realistic estimates of extinction risk.},

  abstract = {Because of human action, the Earth has entered an era where profound changes in the global environment are creating novel conditions that will be discernable far into the future. One consequence may be a large reduction of the Earth's biodiversity, potentially representing a sixth mass extinction. With effective stewardship, the global change drivers that threaten the Earth's biota could be alleviated, but this requires clear understanding of the drivers, their interactions, and how they impact ecological communities. This review identifies 10 anthropogenic global change drivers and discusses how six of the drivers (atmospheric CO2 enrichment, climate change, land transformation, species exploitation, exotic species invasions, eutrophication) impact Earth's biodiversity. Driver impacts on a particular species could be positive or negative. In either case, they initiate secondary responses that cascade along ecological lines of connection and in doing so magnify the initial impact. The unique nature of the threat to the Earth's biodiversity is not simply due to the magnitude of each driver, but due to the speed of change, the novelty of the drivers, and their interactions. Emphasizing one driver, notably climate change, is problematic because the other global change drivers also degrade biodiversity and together threaten the stability of the biosphere. As the main academic journal addressing global change effects on living systems, GCB is well positioned to provide leadership in solving the global change challenge. If humanity cannot meet the challenge, then GCB is positioned to serve as a leading chronicle of the sixth mass extinction to occur on planet Earth.},

  abstract = {Functional response traits influence the ability of species to colonize and thrive in a habitat and to persist under environmental challenges. Functional traits can be used to evaluate environment-related processes and phenomena. They also help to interpret distribution patterns, especially under limiting ecological conditions. In this study, we investigate landscape-scale functional distribution responses of beech forests in a climatic transitional zone in Europe. We construct empirical density distribution responses for beech forests by applying coping-resilience-failure climatic traits based on 27 bioclimatic variables, resulting in prevalence-decay-exclusion distribution response patterns. We also perform multivariate exploratory cluster analysis to reveal significant sets of response patterns from the resilience and adaptation aspects. Temperature-related distribution responses presented a prevalence-dominated functional pattern, with Annual mean temperature indicating the most favorable adaptation function. Precipitation indices showed climate-limited response patterns with the dominance of extinction function. Considering regional site-specific climate change projections, these continental beech forests could regress moderately due to temperature increase in the near future. Our results also suggest that both summer and winter precipitation could play a pivotal role in successful resilience. Functions and variables that indicate climate sensitivity can serve as a useful starting point to develop adaptation measures for regional forest management.},

We investigated whether community composition, summarized with plant functional traits, responded similarly to increasing precipitation among studies and sites. \textbullet{} In field experiments, increased precipitation favored species with small seed size, short leaf life span and high leaf nitrogen (N) concentration. However, with increasing precipitation along the natural gradient, community composition shifted towards species with higher mean seed mass, longer leaf life span and lower leaf N concentrations. \textbullet{} The differences in temporal and spatial scale of experimental manipulations and natural gradients may explain these contrasting results. Our results highlight the complexity of responses to climate change, and suggest that transient dynamics may not reflect long-term shifts in functional diversity and community composition.

  abstract = {A large number of diversity metrics are available to study and monitor biodiversity, and their responses to biodiversity changes are not necessarily coherent with each other. The choice of biodiversity metrics may thus strongly affect our interpretation of biodiversity change and, hence, prioritization of resources for conservation. Therefore it is crucial to understand which metrics respond to certain changes, are the most sensitive to change, show consistent responses across different communities, detect early signals of species decline, and are insensitive to demographic stochasticity. Here we generated synthetic communities and simulated changes in their composition according to 9 scenarios of biodiversity change to investigate the behaviour of 12 biodiversity metrics. Metrics showed diverse abilities to detect changes under different scenarios. S{\o}rensen similarity index, arithmetic and geometric mean abundance, and species and functional richness were the most sensitive to community changes. S{\o}rensen similarity index, species richness and geometric abundance showed consistent responses across all simulated communities and scenarios. S{\o}rensen similarity index and geometric mean abundance were able to detect early signals of species decline. Geometric mean abundance, and functional evenness under certain scenarios, had the greatest ability to distinguish directional trends from stochastic changes, but S{\o}rensen similarity index and geometric mean abundance were the only indices to show consistent signals under all replicates and scenarios. Classic abundance-weighted heterogeneity indices (e.g. Shannon index) were insensitive to certain changes or showed misleading responses, and are therefore unsuitable for comparison of biological communities. We therefore suggest that separate metrics of species composition, richness, and abundance should be reported instead of (or in addition to) composite metrics like the Shannon index.},

  abstract = {Conservation and enhancement of ecological connectivity is widely recognized as one of the key objectives of forest landscape management. However, practical difficulties still exist due to the lack of pragmatic and operational methodologies that can be efficiently applied for these purposes within the scope of a forest management plan. Here we present the novel integration of two recent approaches for analyzing forest structural connectivity that offers considerable synergies and potential relevant benefits for forest planning at a variety of scales. We combine the morphological analysis of forest spatial patterns with recent indices for the analysis of landscape network connectivity based on the concept of measuring habitat availability (reachability) at the landscape scale. The combination of these approaches in a single integrated workflow embraces from (1) the diagnosis and characterization at the pixel level of the forest spatial patterns and their individual constituents, which are mainly the core habitat areas and the structural connectors (bridges) between them, to (2) the assessment of their individual importance to uphold ecological fluxes as irreplaceable providers of structural connectivity. We present and show different analytical possibilities within the integrated workflow from where the manager can choose depending on the planning targets and on the characteristics of the ecological processes of interest. We illustrate the application of the combined approach in two forested areas in Central Spain with different scales and management contexts, in which the structural connectivity between forest habitat areas needs to be sustained. Our assessment was able to discriminate and highlight a concise subset of cores and bridges that concentrated most of the contribution to the overall connectivity and functioning of the forest habitat network. This provides clear guidelines on where the conservation management efforts should be targeted, allowing for many alternative areas where the rest of the management objectives and activities can be accommodated as required by the multifunctionality of forest resources. The proposed integrated approach can equally serve to identify (a) those forest areas that play a crucial role to sustain ecological fluxes that are to be promoted by management, such as the dispersal of native biota or (b) those sites where the spread of wildfires or invasive species can be halted more effectively. The potential of the proposed methodology to inform and guide forestry decisions is reinforced by the availability of the required analytical tools (Guidos and Conefor Sensinode) as freeware software packages.},

For these reasons many different connectivity indices have been used or proposed for landscape conservation planning; however, their properties and behaviour have not been sufficiently examined and may provide misleading or undesired results for these purposes. We here present a new index (probability of connectivity, PC) that is based on the habitat availability concept, dispersal probabilities between habitat patches and graph structures. We evaluate the performance of PC and compare it with other widespread indices through a set of 13 relevant properties that an index should ideally fulfil for adequately integrating connectivity in landscape planning applications. We found that PC is the only index that systematically accomplished all the requirements, overcoming some serious limitations of other available indices. We encourage the use of PC as a sound basis for planning decision-making. To demonstrate the use and potential of PC for practical landscape applications, we present an example of application to a case study for the goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) in Catalonia (NE Spain), where we identify those habitat areas that most contribute to overall landscape connectivity and evaluate the effectiveness and potential improvement of a protected areas network (Natura 2000) for conserving those critical habitat areas.},

Despite this, few experiments have isolated the effects of temperature for this scenario on trees and forests.

Adaptation to varying temperatures revolves around the trade-off between utilizing the full growing season and minimizing frost damage through proper timing of hardening in autumn and dehardening in spring. But the evolutionary change in these traits must be sufficiently rapid to compensate for the temperature changes.

  abstract = {In the coming century, forecast climate changes caused by increasing greenhouse gases may produce dramatic shifts in tree species distributions and the rates at which individual tree species sequester carbon or release carbon back to the atmosphere. The species composition and carbon storage capacity of northern Wisconsin (USA) forests are expected to change significantly as a result. Projected temperature changes are relatively large (up to a 5.8 1C increase in mean annual temperature) and these forests encompass a broad ecotone that may be particularly sensitive to climate change. Our objective was to estimate the combined effects of climate change, common disturbances, and species migrations on regional forests using spatially interactive simulations. Multiple scenarios were simulated for 200 years to estimate aboveground live biomass and tree species composition. We used a spatially interactive forest landscape model (LANDIS-II) that includes individual tree species, biomass accumulation and decomposition, windthrow, harvesting, and seed dispersal. We used data from two global circulation models, the Hadley Climate Centre (version 2) and the Canadian Climate Center (version 1) to generate transient growth and decomposition parameters for 23 species. The two climate change scenarios were compared with a control scenario of continuing current climate conditions. The results demonstrate how important spatially interactive processes will affect the aboveground live biomass and species composition of northern Wisconsin forests. Forest composition, including species richness, is strongly affected by harvesting, windthrow, and climate change, although five northern species (Abies balsamea, Betula papyrifera, Picea glauca, Pinus banksiana, P. resinosa) are lost in both climate scenarios regardless of disturbance scenario. Changes in aboveground live biomass over time are nonlinear and vary among ecoregions. Aboveground live biomass will be significantly reduced because of species dispersal and migration limitations. The expected shift towards southern oaks and hickory is delayed because of seed dispersal limitations.},

  abstract = {Species-rich tropical communities are expected to be more specialized than their temperate counterparts [1\textendash{}3]. Several studies have reported increasing biotic specialization toward the tropics [4\textendash{}7], whereas others have not found latitudinal trends once accounting for sampling bias [8, 9] or differences in plant diversity [10, 11]. Thus, the direction of the latitudinal specialization gradient remains contentious. With an unprecedented global data set, we investigated how biotic specialization between plants and animal pollinators or seed dispersers is associated with latitude, past and contemporary climate, and plant diversity. We show that in contrast to expectation, biotic specialization of mutualistic networks is significantly lower at tropical than at temperate latitudes. Specialization was more closely related to contemporary climate than to past climate stability, suggesting that current conditions have a stronger effect on biotic specialization than historical community stability. Biotic specialization decreased with increasing local and regional plant diversity. This suggests that high specialization of mutualistic interactions is a response of pollinators and seed dispersers to low plant diversity. This could explain why the latitudinal specialization gradient is reversed relative to the latitudinal diversity gradient. Low mutualistic network specialization in the tropics suggests higher tolerance against extinctions in tropical than in temperate communities.},

  abstract = {Range dynamics causes mismatches between a species' geographical distribution and the set of suitable environments in which population growth is positive (the Hutchinsonian niche). This is because source\textendash{}sink population dynamics cause species to occupy unsuitable environments, and because environmental change creates non-equilibrium situations in which species may be absent from suitable environments (due to migration limitation) or present in unsuitable environments that were previously suitable (due to time-delayed extinction). Because correlative species distribution models do not account for these processes, they are likely to produce biased niche estimates and biased forecasts of future range dynamics. Recently developed dynamic range models (DRMs) overcome this problem: they statistically estimate both range dynamics and the underlying environmental response of demographic rates from species distribution data. This process-based statistical approach qualitatively advances biogeographical analyses. Yet, the application of DRMs to a broad range of species and study systems requires substantial research efforts in statistical modelling, empirical data collection and ecological theory. Here we review current and potential contributions of these fields to a demographic understanding of niches and range dynamics. Our review serves to formulate a demographic research agenda that entails: (1) advances in incorporating process-based models of demographic responses and range dynamics into a statistical framework, (2) systematic collection of data on temporal changes in distribution and abundance and on the response of demographic rates to environmental variation, and (3) improved theoretical understanding of the scaling of demographic rates and the dynamics of spatially coupled populations. This demographic research agenda is challenging but necessary for improved comprehension and quantification of niches and range dynamics. It also forms the basis for understanding how niches and range dynamics are shaped by evolutionary dynamics and biotic interactions. Ultimately, the demographic research agenda should lead to deeper integration of biogeography with empirical and theoretical ecology.},

In boreal forests, compositional shifts from late-successional conifers to early-successional conifers and deciduous broadleaves have been postulated based on increased fire frequency associated with climate change truncating stand age-dependent succession. However, little is known about how climate change has affected forest composition in the background between successive catastrophic fires in boreal forests. Using 1797 permanent sample plots from western boreal forests of Canada measured from 1958 to 2013, we show that after accounting for stand age-dependent succession, the relative abundances of early-successional deciduous broadleaves and early-successional conifers have increased at the expense of late-successional conifers with climate change. These background compositional shifts are persistent temporally, consistent across all forest stand ages and pervasive spatially across the region. Rising atmospheric CO2 promoted early-successional conifers and deciduous broadleaves, and warming increased early-successional conifers at the expense of late-successional conifers, but compositional shifts were not associated with climate moisture index. Our results emphasize the importance of climate change on background compositional shifts in the boreal forest and suggest further compositional shifts as rising CO2 and warming will continue in the 21st century.},

Under the emerging biogeochemical configurations, management activities are experiments, blurring the line between basic and applied research. Responses to specific management manipulations are context specific, influenced by the current status or structure of the system, and this necessitates reference areas for management or restoration activities. Attempts to return systems to within their historical range of biotic and abiotic characteristics and processes may not be possible, and management activities directed at removing undesirable features of novel ecosystems may perpetuate or create such ecosystems. Management actions should attempt to maintain genetic and species diversity and encourage the biogeochemical characteristics that favor desirable species.

  abstract = {Disturbances are key drivers of forest ecosystem dynamics, and forests are well adapted to their natural disturbance regimes. However, as a result of climate change, disturbance frequency is expected to increase in the future in many regions. It is not yet clear how such changes might affect forest ecosystems, and which mechanisms contribute to (current and future) disturbance resilience. We studied a 6364-ha landscape in the western Cascades of Oregon, USA, to investigate how patches of remnant old-growth trees (as one important class of biological legacies) affect the resilience of forest ecosystems to disturbance. Using the spatially explicit, individual-based, forest landscape model iLand, we analyzed the effect of three different levels of remnant patches (0\%, 12\%, and 24\% of the landscape) on 500-year recovery trajectories after a large, high-severity wildfire. In addition, we evaluated how three different levels of fire frequency modulate the effects of initial legacies. We found that remnant live trees enhanced the recovery of total ecosystem carbon (TEC) stocks after disturbance, increased structural complexity of forest canopies, and facilitated the recolonization of late-seral species (LSS). Legacy effects were most persistent for indicators of species composition (still significant 500 years after disturbance), while TEC (i.e., a measure of ecosystem functioning) was least affected, with no significant differences among legacy scenarios after 236 years. Compounding disturbances were found to dampen legacy effects on all indicators, and higher initial legacy levels resulted in elevated fire severity in the second half of the study period. Overall, disturbance frequency had a stronger effect on ecosystem properties than the initial level of remnant old-growth trees. A doubling of the historically observed fire frequency to a mean fire return interval of 131 years reduced TEC by 10.5\% and lowered the presence of LSS on the landscape by 18.1\% on average, demonstrating that an increase in disturbance frequency (a potential climate change effect) may considerably alter the structure, composition, and functioning of forest landscapes. Our results indicate that live tree legacies are an important component of disturbance resilience, underlining the potential of retention forestry to address challenges in ecosystem management.},

While species diversity, presence and abundance are most commonly used to measure the effects of human pressures, demographic responses give a more proximal indication of how pressures affect population viability and contribute to extinction risk. We reviewed how demographic rates are affected by the major anthropogenic pressures, changed landscape condition caused by human land use, and climate change. We synthesized the results of 147 empirical studies to compare the relative effect size of climate and landscape condition on birth, death, immigration and emigration rates in plant and animal populations. While changed landscape condition is recognized as the major driver of species declines and losses worldwide, we found that, on average, climate variables had equally strong effects on demographic rates in plant and animal populations. This is significant given that the pressures of climate change will continue to intensify in coming decades. The effects of climate change on some populations may be underestimated because changes in climate conditions during critical windows of species life cycles may have disproportionate effects on demographic rates. The combined pressures of land-use change and climate change may result in species declines and extinctions occurring faster than otherwise predicted, particularly if their effects are multiplicative.},

Location California Floristic Province, United States; mediterranean biome. Methods We related Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data from 2000-07 for 13 tree species to high-resolution climate and geographical data. Using methods from invasion ecology, we derived indices of species-specific regeneration overlap and central tendency change (range-wide global indicators) based on kernel density estimation of presence and absence of regeneration. We then built regeneration surfaces to identify areas of occurrence of high regeneration (regeneration hotspots, local indicators) in both geographical and climate space for 13 common tree species. Results Differences between presence and absence of regeneration in forests varied in magnitude across species, with little evidence that tree regeneration is shifting to higher latitudes and elevations, the expected geographical fingerprint of climate change. We also identified potential topographic mediators of regeneration dynamics. Multiple regeneration hotspots were found for many species, suggesting the influence of non-climatic factors on regeneration. Differences between the presence and absence of regeneration in geographic and climate spaces were not always congruent, suggesting that shifting climate space and range area are not entirely coupled. Main conclusions The distributions of regeneration in Californian forests show diverse signals, not always tracking the higher latitudinal\textendash{}elevation fingerprint of climate change. Local regeneration hotspots are common in our analysis, suggesting spatially varying persistence of forest linked to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Our results emphasize that projections of tree range shifts in the context of climate change should consider the variation of regeneration drivers within species ranges, beyond the overall climate signal.},

The question remains of how to fill gaps in conservation systems efficiently. Conservation prioritization software can identify those areas outside existing conservation areas that contribute to the efficient covering of gaps in biodiversity features. We show how environmental gap analysis can be implemented using high-resolution information about environmental variables and ecosystem condition with the publicly available conservation prioritization software, Zonation. Our method is based on the conversion of combinations of environmental variables into biodiversity features. We also replicated the analysis by using Species Distribution Models (SDMs) as biodiversity features to evaluate the robustness and utility of our environment-based analysis.

This promise is a major reason for the increased popularity of this approach. Here, we argue that some important foundational assumptions of trait-based ecology have not received sufficient empirical evaluation. We identify three such assumptions and, where possible, suggest methods of improvement: (i) traits are functional to the degree that they determine individual fitness, (ii) intraspecific variation in functional traits can be largely ignored, and (iii) functional traits show general predictive relationships to measurable environmental gradients.},

One possible explanation for the disparity is that local ASE are difficult to maintain regionally in patch dynamic models. Here we examine two possible mechanisms for regional coexistence of species engaged in local ASE. Biotically generated heterogeneity (e.g., habitat modification that favors further invasion by conspecifics) results in regional exclusion of one species at equilibrium. In contrast, abiotic heterogeneity due to spatial variation in resource supply ratios generates local-scale ASE and ensures regional coexistence with sufficiently broad environmental gradients. Abiotic heterogeneity can result in a species that is the dominant competitor over some of its range being excluded if the area where it is dominant is too small. Biotic heterogeneity can lead to alternative stable landscapes or regional priority effects, while abiotic heterogeneity results in regional determinism. Broad environmental gradients in resource supply favor regional coexistence of species that exhibit local ASE.},

With this need in mind, the rate and spatial pattern of mortality was assessed over an 89-year period in a natural-origin Pinus resinosa (Aiton)-dominated system to assess these processes through advanced stages of stand development (stand age 120\textendash{}209 years). Average annual mortality rates fluctuated through time, yet were within the range reported in other studies (0.60\%\textendash{}3.88\% depending on species and sampling interval). Tree mortality was attributed to multiple agents, including the senescence of the short-lived Pinus banksiana Lamb., windthrow, root-rot fungi (Armillaria ostoyae (Romagn.) Herink), and perhaps infrequent droughts. Despite the often contagious nature of many disturbance agents, the overall spatial pattern of mortality events (the arrangement of dead trees within the fixed initial population of live trees) was random at all scales tested. Similarly, the current spatial pattern of dead trees was predominantly random, despite clustering at small scales (2\textendash{}4 m). These findings underscore the importance of studying mortality rates, agents, and spatial patterns over long time periods to avoid misinterpreting stochastic mortality events, and their influence on longer term stand structure and development.},

  abstract = {Rising global temperatures are suggested to be drivers of shifts in tree species ranges. The resulting changes in community composition may negatively impact forest ecosystem function. However, long-term shifts in tree species ranges remain poorly documented. We test for shifts in the northern range limits of 16 temperate tree species in Quebec, Canada, using forest inventory data spanning three decades, 15\textdegree{} of longitude and 7\textdegree{} of latitude. Range shifts were correlated with climate warming and dispersal traits to understand potential mechanisms underlying changes. Shifts were calculated as the change in the 95th percentile of latitudinal occurrence between two inventory periods (1970\textendash{}1978, 2000\textendash{}2012) and for two life stages: saplings and adults. We also examined sapling and adult range offsets within each inventory, and changes in the offset through time. Tree species ranges shifted predominantly northward, although species responses varied. As expected shifts were greater for tree saplings, 0.34 km yr{\`A}1, than for adults, 0.13 km yr{\`A}1. Range limits were generally further north for adults compared to saplings, but the difference diminished through time, consistent with patterns observed for range shifts within each life stage. This suggests caution should be exercised when interpreting geographic range offsets between life stages as evidence of range shifts in the absence of temporal data. Species latitudinal velocities were on average {$<$}50\% of the velocity required to equal the spatial velocity of climate change and were mostly unrelated to dispersal traits. Finally, our results add to the body of evidence suggesting tree species are mostly limited in their capacity to track climate warming, supporting concerns that warming will negatively impact the functioning of forest ecosystems.},

The profiles thus obtained are obviously related to niche concepts in the Grinnell tradition, and separated from those in Elton{\~O}s tradition. I argue that it is useful to define Grinnellian and Eltonian niches on the basis of the types of variables used to calculate them, the natural spatial scale at which they can be measured, and the dispersal of the individuals over the environment. I use set theory notation and analogies derived from population ecology theory to obtain formal definitions of areas of distribution and several types of niches. This brings clarity to several practical and fundamental questions in macroecology and biogeography.},

Land use and land cover (LULC) data are important predictor variables for determining species range, yet are rarely used when modeling future distributions. In this study, maximum entropy modeling was used to construct species distribution maps for 50 North American bird species to determine relative contributions of climate and LULC for contemporary (2001) and future (2075) time periods. Species presence data were used as a dependent variable, while climate, LULC, and topographic data were used as predictor variables. Results varied by species, but in general, measures of model fit for 2001 indicated significantly poorer fit when either climate or LULC data were excluded from model simulations. Climate covariates provided a higher contribution to 2001 model results than did LULC variables, although both categories of variables strongly contributed. The area deemed to be ``suitable'' for 2001 species presence was strongly affected by the choice of model covariates, with significantly larger ranges predicted when LULC was excluded as a covariate. Changes in species ranges for 2075 indicate much larger overall range changes due to projected climate change than due to projected LULC change. However, the choice of study area impacted results for both current and projected model applications, with truncation of actual species ranges resulting in lower model fit scores and increased difficulty in interpreting covariate impacts on species range. Results indicate species-specific response to climate and LULC variables; however, both climate and LULC variables clearly are important for modeling both contemporary and potential future species ranges.},

Some of the most complex of these processes are cross-scale interactions (CSIs), which occur when components interact across scales. When undetected, such interactions may cause errors in extrapolation from one region to another. CSIs, particularly those that include a regional scaled component, have not been systematically investigated or even reported because of the challenges of acquiring data at sufficiently broad spatial extents. We present an approach for quantifying CSIs and apply it to a case study investigating one such interaction, between local and regional scaled land-use drivers of lake phosphorus. Ultimately, our approach for investigating CSIs can serve as a basis for efforts to understand a wide variety of multi-scaled problems such as climate change, land-use/land-cover change, and invasive species.},

By failing to consider current knowledge, therefore, natural resource scientists and managers may be harming the species and systems they are charged with protecting. Most ecologists agree that the conservation of biodiversity is facilitated by maintaining population densities and distributions of strongly interactive species above estimable thresholds for ecological effectiveness. Assuming that conservation biologists and natural resource managers are ``physicians to nature,'' we therefore propose they are obligated to adhere to a doctrine of ``best conservation practices based on the best science,'' applying a more rigorous standard for the management of relatively interactive species than may be mandated by older statutes and effected by current practice and convention.},

This is not accurate if more than one transition can occur per time interval. In such cases, continuous-time Markov chains may be better, and discretetime models may overestimate the complexity of species interactions. We reanalyze data from a marine community. A continuous-time model with homogeneous rates is not significantly worse than the maximum-likelihood discrete-time model. Compared to the continuous-time model, the discrete-time model overestimates the complexity of interspecific interactions. We also discuss the entropy of a continuous-time Markov chain, another measure of complexity.},

There will be benefits as well as loses and an important component of adaptation will be balancing values. Adaptation options to respond to impacts on the timber supply in Canada for the next 50 to 100 years are limited mainly to forest protection and wood utilisation because these forests are already in the ground. Adaptation through reforestation will focus on commercial tree species. It is important to start developing adaptation strategies now. These include assessing forest vulnerability to climate change, revising expectations of forest use, determining research and educational needs, development of forest policies to facilitate adaptation, and determining when to implement responses. Government agencies should take the lead in creating an environment to foster adaptation in forestry and in developing the necessary information required to respond.},

  abstract = {Generalizations regarding the mechanisms underlying the effects of plant diversity on ecosystem processes, and whether the patterns transcend study systems remain elusive. Many terrestrial plant diversity manipulations have found that plant biomass increases with diversity, but most marine studies find little or no effect of seaweed diversity on producer biomass or production. However, differences in experimental approach (field vs. mesocosm) and duration (years vs. weeks) between published terrestrial and marine experiments confound the interpretation of these differences in response to changing diversity. We conducted a three-year field manipulation of seaweed diversity on intertidal rocky reefs in central California, USA, to examine the effect of diversity on seaweed cover. We found that diversity increased standing algal cover and decreased the availability of free space relative to monocultures, but this effect took nine months to materialize. Furthermore, diverse assemblages did not consistently exceed the best performing monocultures until 18 months after the experiment was initiated, suggesting that the effect of diversity strengthens over time. Overall, diversity's effect was consistently stronger than that of individual species and not attributable to the influence of any particular species (sampling effect) because (1) polycultures eventually achieved higher cover than even the best performing monoculture and (2) monocultures rarely differed much, precluding a strong sampling effect. Instead, mechanisms such as facilitation and differential use of microhabitats in a heterogeneous environment likely caused the higher cover in polycultures. Our findings contrast with short-term experiments with other seaweeds but are similar to longer-term experiments with terrestrial plants, suggesting that experimental design and approach, rather than inherent differences between marine and terrestrial ecosystems, underlie contrasting responses among systems. We argue that experiments conducted in the field, and for a greater length of time, allow for the manifestation of a greater number of potential mechanisms of overyielding in diverse communities, increasing the likelihood of observing a strong diversity effect.},

We tested the hypothesis by measuring the impact of manipulating connectivity in experimental metacommunties of a natural and diverse microecosystem. Isolation led to the extinction of large-bodied apex predators, subsequently followed by increases in prey species abundance. This trophic cascade was associated with significantly altered carbon and nitrogen fluxes in fragmented treatments. The ecosystem impacts were characteristic of a function debt because they persisted for several generations after the initial loss of connectivity. Local extinctions and disruption of ecosystem processes were mitigated, and even reversed, by the presence of corridors in the connected metacommunities, although these beneficial effects were unexpectedly delayed. We hypothesized that corridors maintained grazer movement between fragments, which enhanced microbial activity, and decomposition in comparison to isolated fragments. Our results indicate that knowledge of habitat connectivity and spatial processes is essential to understand the magnitude and timing of ecosystem perturbation in fragmented landscapes.},

This disconnect is largely due to the different spatial scales considered by the two sub-disciplines: macroecologists study patterns at large extents and coarse resolutions, while community ecologists focus on small extents and fine resolutions. A general framework for including biotic interactions in macroecological models would help bridge this divide, as it would allow for rigorous testing of the role that biotic interactions play in determining species ranges. Here, we present an approach that combines species distribution models with Bayesian networks, which enables the direct and indirect effects of biotic interactions to be modelled as propagating conditional dependencies among species' presences. We show that including biotic interactions in distribution models for species from a California grassland community results in better range predictions across the western USA. This new approach will be important for improving estimates of species distributions and their dynamics under environmental change.},

  abstract = {1. Methods used to predict shifts in species' ranges because of climate change commonly involve species distribution (niche) modelling using climatic variables, future values of which are predicted for the next several decades by general circulation models. However, species' distributions also depend on factors other than climate, such as land cover, land use and soil type. Changes in some of these factors, such as soil type, occur over geologic time and are thus imperceptible over the timescale of these types of projections. Other factors, such as land use and land cover, are expected to change over shorter timescales, but reliable projections are not available. Some important predictor variables, therefore, must be treated as unchanging, or static, whether because of the properties of the variable or out of necessity. The question of how best to combine dynamic variables predicted by climate models with static variables is not trivial and has been dealt with differently in studies to date. Alternative methods include using the static variables as masks, including them as independent explanatory variables in the model, or excluding them altogether.},

In forests, canopy disturbances such as fire may hasten this process by increasing temperature and moisture stress in the understory, yet little is known about the mechanisms that might drive such shifts, or the consequences of these processes for plant diversity. We sampled understory vegetation across a gradient of disturbance severity from a large-scale natural experiment created by the factorial combination of forest thinning and wildfire in California. Using information on evolutionary history and functional traits, we tested the hypothesis that disturbance severity should increase community dominance by species with southern-xeric biogeographic affinities. We also analysed how climatic productivity mediates the effect of disturbance severity, and quantified the functional trait response to disturbance, to investigate potential mechanisms behind thermophilization. The proportion of north-temperate flora decreased, while the proportion of southern-xeric flora increased, with greater disturbance severity and less canopy closure. Disturbance caused a greater reduction of north-temperate flora in productive (wetter) forests, while functional trait analyses suggested that species colonizing after severe disturbance may be adapted to increased water stress. Forests with intermediate disturbance severity, where abundances of northern and southern species were most equitable, had the highest stand-scale understory diversity. Synthesis. Canopy disturbance is likely to accelerate plant community shifts towards species from warmer regions, via its effects on understory microclimate at small scales. Understory diversity can be enhanced by intermediate disturbance regimes that promote the coexistence of species with different biogeographic affinities.},

In this paper, we develop a Markov chain approach for the modelling of forest stand dynamics. The aim of this work is to generalize the recently developed Perfect Plasticity Approximation (PPA) model for scaling of vegetation dynamics from individual level to the landscape level through the ecosystem hierarchical structure. Our basic assumption is that the forested ecosystem and disturbance regimes can be modelled on 3 hierarchical scales (levels): individual trees, forest stand (or patch, defined as a spatial unit about 0.5\textendash{}1~ha of the same forest at one successional stage.) and landscape (collection of forest patches of different forest/soil types at different successional stages) levels. In our modelling approach the PPA model is an intermediate step for scaling from the individual level to the forest stand level (or patch level). In this paper we develop a Markov chain model for stage-structured dynamics of forest stands (patches). In order to determine the structure of the Markov chain model and estimate parameters, we analyze the patch-mosaic patterns of forest stands of the Lake States (MI, WI, and MN) recorded in the USDA FIA database as well as data for other US states and Canada. The distribution of macroscopic characteristics of a large collection of forest patches is considered as an estimate of the stationary distribution of the underlying Markov chain. The data demonstrates that this distribution is unimodal and skewed to the right. We identify the simplest Markov chain that produces such a distribution and estimate the upper bound of the probability of disaster for this Markov chain.},

A number of these studies indicate that boreal forests are experiencing widespread browning, and have suggested that these patterns reflect decreases in forest productivity induced by climate change. Here we use NDVI time series from Landsat, which has much higher quality and spatial resolution than imagery used in most previous studies, to characterize biogeographic patterns in greening and browning across Canada's boreal forest and to explore the drivers behind observed trends. Our results show that the majority of NDVI changes in Canada's boreal forest reflect disturbance-recovery dynamics not climate change impacts, that greening and browning trends outside of disturbed forests are consistent with expected ecological responses to regional changes in climate, and that observed NDVI changes are geographically limited and relatively small in magnitude. By examining covariance between changes in NDVI and temperature and precipitation in locations not affected by disturbance, our results isolate and characterize the nature and magnitude of greening and browning directly associated with climate change. Consistent with biogeographic theory, greening and browning unrelated to disturbance tended to be located in ecotones near boundaries of the boreal forest bioclimatic envelope. We observed greening to be most prevalent in Eastern Canada, which is more humid, and browning to be most prevalent in Western Canada, where forests are more prone to moisture stress. We conclude that continued long-term climate change has the potential to significantly alter the character and function of Canada's boreal forest, but recent changes have been modest and near-term impacts are likely to be focused in or near ecotones.},

In all model-based statistical inference, the likelihood function is of central importance, since it expresses the probability of the observed data under a particular statistical model, and thus quantifies the support data lend to particular values of parameters and to choices among different models. For simple models, an analytical formula for the likelihood function can typically be derived. However, for more complex models, an analytical formula might be elusive or the likelihood function might be computationally very costly to evaluate. ABC methods bypass the evaluation of the likelihood function. In this way, ABC methods widen the realm of models for which statistical inference can be considered. ABC methods are mathematically well-founded, but they inevitably make assumptions and approximations whose impact needs to be carefully assessed. Furthermore, the wider application domain of ABC exacerbates the challenges of parameter estimation and model selection. ABC has rapidly gained popularity over the last years and in particular for the analysis of complex problems arising in biological sciences (e.g., in population genetics, ecology, epidemiology, and systems biology).},

  abstract = {Range limits and broad-scale geographic variations in the productivity of boreal and northern deciduous tree species in Europe are simulated with a bioclimatic model (STASH). STASH is based on a small number of distinct mechanisms by which climate is thought to affect the survival, regeneration and growth of trees. Survival is limited by summer warmth requirements and winter cold tolerance; regeneration, additionally by winter chilling requirements; and growth rate by net assimilation, which in turn is related to photosynthetically active radiation, growing-season length, temperature (relative to species-specific optima) and soil moisture supply (relative to evaporative demand). These mechanisms are quantified either as thresholds (for survival and regeneration) or multipliers (for growth), based on bioclimatic variables computed from monthly climate normals interpolated three-dimensionally to a 10-minute grid. Growing-season and growing degree day calculations take into account the effects of chilling. The drought calculations also take into account the effects of soil-moisture storage by means of a physically based evapotranspiration calculation coupled to a one-layer soil hydrology model. STASH is used to examine changes in potential range limits under a 2xCO,\_ climate-change scenario. Associated transient responses at selected sites in the boreal and boreo-nemoral zones of Sweden are also simulated, using the forest gap model FORSKA2. The speciesspecific survival and regeneration constraints and growth responses of STASH modify the growth, establishment and mortality of trees in FORSKA2. The results obtained in this way differ sharply from the results of conventional forest gap models, where growth rates are assumed to decline to zero at minimum and maximum growing degree day limits. For example, towards the southern limit of Picea abies (Norway spruce), STASH correctly shows no decline in productivity, but rather an abrupt cut-off corresponding to a chilling requirement during regeneration that is not met further south or west. In transient warming scenarios, this mechanism has the effect that natural regeneration can be blocked due to the warm winters even as yield is increasing due to the longer and warmer summers. STASH predicts drastic changes in species distributions in response to the large climate changes (especially winter warming) expected for northern Europe. Some of the common boreal species (e.g., Picea abies; Pinus sylvestris) Alnus incana) are unlikely to survive in much of their present range, withdrawing to the far north. Other species already widespread may be able to occupy some of the few sites that are today unavailable to them (e.g., Betula spp.; Corylus avellana). Other temperate deciduous species such as Fagus sylvatica could have dramatic range expansions, potentially occupying large tracts of the present boreal zone. FORSKA2 transient simulations illustrate some of the possible routes towards different types of forest in a changed climate. Some sites in the north show little change in species composition, but sites towards the southern boundary of the boreal zone could develop a new suite of dominants. The degree of sensitivity of a particular site depends both on the climate change prediction and on the transient dynamics of the forest community. Many types of transient behaviour are shown to be possible. Coupled with uncertainties about the future role of dispersal and changes in disturbance rate, the complexity and variety of these transient responses imply a highly uncertain future for the north European boreal forests.},

CO2-induced climate wanning scenarios cause major changes in these limits. The dominant conifers of the mixed conifer/northern hardwoods zone, Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris, retreat from the south and west while Fagussylvatica and other temperate hardwoods spread to the north. A gap model (FORSKA 2) is used to simulate the associated transientresponses of a forest reserve within this zone. In both dry Pinus- and moist Picea-dominated forest communities, Picea continues to increase while Pinus sooner or later declines. These changes are continuing successional (non-climatic) responses to the cessation of disturbance 150 years ago. Climate warming speeds up the succession, and allows Fagus to establish and increase. The eventual decline of Picea however is delayed due to the persistence of old-growth stands. Picea forests subject to continuing disturbance show a more rapid shift to dominance by Fagus and other temperate hardwoods. Delayed immigration of new species, including Fagus, would favour early- successional species such as Betula pendula and Quercus spp. in a forest with reduced biomass and diversity. The results emphasise the complex and sometimes counter-intuitive nature of transient responses, and the importance of considering disturbance history and potential migration rates when predicting the impacts of rapid climate change on forests.},

Conclusions regarding these changes greatly depend on the choice of indicator. Here, we propose a new metric, the distance biochange index (DBCI), that enables the characterization and quantification of both the level and direction of change in biological communities relative to a given reference state. The proposed metric uses conditional probabilities to assess the probability of observing a complete change in a given community and can be decomposed into four conditional probabilities of change: no change, complete change in species composition only, complete change in species richness only, and complete change in both species composition and richness. In this study, we compared the properties of DBCI and BCI, a similarity version of DBCI, with those of other widely used indices. We also proposed a new approach, based on the use of partial derivatives, to assess the sensitivity of six similarity indices over a wide range of contrasting scenarios of change. Finally, we extended the application of DBCI to a simulated case study of the predicted evolution of suitable habitats for 20 species under climate change. Results from this simulation demonstrated that DBCI provides an accurate assessment of the level and direction of change. Results also show that DBCI can be used to reflect the effect of ecological gradients on species composition and species richness in biological communities.},

This method is applied to a published data set from San Francisco of tuberculosis genotypes based on the marker IS6110. The mutation rate of this marker has previously been studied, and we use those estimates to form a prior distribution of mutation rates in the inference procedure. The posterior point estimates of the key parameters of interest for these data are as follows: net transmission rate, 0.69/year [95\% credibility interval (C.I.) 0.38, 1.08]; doubling time, 1.08 years (95\% C.I. 0.64, 1.82); and reproductive value 3.4 (95\% C.I. 1.4, 79.7).

  abstract = {One of the major questions in ecology is, what controls the structure of communities? We used projection matrix models to examine community dynamics and patterns of succession. The inputs of the model are transition probabilities of species replacements that were measured repeatedly during a long\textemdash{}term (1962\textemdash{}1989) study of diverse coral assemblages on Heron Island, Great Barrier Reef. Transitions varied strikingly among species and sites, reflecting differences in recruitment, growth, longevity (persistence), and the rate of replacement of one species by another. Species that had a poor ability to persist (e.g., algae and Pocilloporid corals) were generally good colonists. The observed number of transitions expressed as a proportion of the maximum number possible provides an index of the complexity of interactions in an assemblage, analogous to the concept of connectance in food\textemdash{}web analysis. Transitions occurred to and from nearly every species group, indicating that there was no competitive dominant in this system. We use the models in simulations to track transitory changes in species abundance and community composition following a major disturbance (e.g., due to a cyclone or outbreak of crown\textemdash{}of\textemdash{}thorns starfish). Some species showed a rapid initial increase followed by a decline to lower equilibrium levels, while others increased smoothly to a generally higher equilibrial abundance. The length of time required to reach a climax assemblage using the same matrix recurrently (\textdegree{}20 yr) is far greater than the observed interval between major disturbances, supporting nonequilibrium theories of coral reef communities. Climax assemblages were highly diverse and varied in composition from site to site. The intermediate disturbance ``hypothesis'' does not fully predict successional changes in these shallow\textemdash{}water coral assemblages since diversity remained very high at equilibrium (i.e., long after major disturbance). Competitively inferior species were not eliminated because routine mortality ensured that some space always remained available for colonization. We also present a novel method for quantifying the relative importance of each species interaction to community composition and the rate of succession, based on a sensitivity analysis of the transition matrix. The analysis shows that the importance of a species to the dynamics of a community may be unrelated to its abundance at equilibrium, with some rare species groups having a greater impact than more common ones. Sensitivity analysis of this type will provide a powerful means of identifying ``keystone'' species in complex assemblages where experimental manipulation of each species is impossible.},

In aquatic sciences, this effort is expanding the scope of questions and analyses that can be performed to further our knowledge of the global drivers of water quality. Cyanotoxin concentration is one variable that has received considerable attention, and although strong local-scale models have been described in the literature, modelling cyanotoxin concentrations across broader spatial scales has been more difficult. Commonly used statistical frameworks have not fully captured the complex response of toxic algal blooms to global change, limiting our ability to predict and mitigate the impairment of freshwaters by toxic algae. Here, we advance our understanding of emergent drivers of cyanotoxins across a structured landscape by applying a hierarchical ``hurdle'' model. Location Lakes and reservoirs in the conterminous United States [n = 1127]. Methods We studied cyanobacteria and their toxins [microcystins] during the 2007 summer period. We applied a hierarchical zero-altered model to test the importance of multi-scale interactions among environmental features in driving microcystin concentrations above the limit of detection. We then used boosted regression trees [BRTs] to identify environmental thresholds associated with severe impairment by microcystins. Results Accounting for numerous non-detections, spatial heterogeneity and cross-scale interactions substantially improved continental-scale predictions of bloom toxicity. Our model accounted for 55\% of the variance in the probability of detecting microcystins across the United States, and 26\% of the variability in microcystin concentrations once detected. BRTs further showed that although both local and regional drivers were associated with microcystin concentrations at low to intermediate provisional guidelines, only local drivers came into play when predicting higher limits. Main conclusions Identifying the interaction between local and regional processes is key to understanding the heterogeneous responses of microcystins to environmental change. Our framework could increase the effectiveness of continental-scale analyses for many different water variables.},

Location The northern temperate forests of the Lower St. Lawrence region (Quebec, Canada). Methods Changes in relative prevalence of tree taxa were reconstructed with early land survey records (1821\textendash{}1900) and modern forest inventories (1980\textendash{}2010). Forest composition reconstructions were then used to analyse changes in tree taxa assemblages at the landscape scale and test for potential landscape homogenization. Results Our results show important maple (Acer saccharum and A. rubrum) and poplar (Populus tremuloides and P. balsamifera) encroachment, shifting from the 6th to the 2nd position of relative prevalence and from the 7th to the 5th position, respectively, resulting in a significant shift in tree assemblage. Maple has spread throughout the whole landscape and tended to become the most abundant taxon in communities where they were already present in pre-settlement times. Poplar also widely spread throughout the landscape but rarely became the most abundant taxon. Accordingly, deciduous encroachment clearly engendered a spatial homogenization of composition at the landscape scale. Conclusion Considering that both red maple and trembling aspen are opportunist early-successional species, the increased relative prevalence of both species, as well as the consequent reorganization of tree taxon assemblages and landscape homogenization, probably resulted from the regional convergence toward an early-successional state. Along with the restoration of long-lived shade-tolerant conifer populations, land and forest managers should aim to increase the heterogeneity of forest stand composition to improve forests resilience to future global changes.},

  abstract = {There is general consensus that wildfires in boreal forests will increase throughout this century in response to more severe and frequent drought conditions induced by climate change. However, prediction models generally assume that the vegetation component will remain static over the next few decades. As deciduous species are less flammable than conifer species, it is reasonable to believe that a potential expansion of deciduous species in boreal forests, either occurring naturally or through landscape management, could offset some of the impacts of climate change on the occurrence of boreal wildfires. The objective of this study was to determine the potential of this offsetting effect through a simulation experiment conducted in eastern boreal North America. Predictions of future fire activity were made using multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) with fire behavior indices and ecological niche models as predictor variables so as to take into account the effects of changing climate and tree distribution on fire activity. A regional climate model (RCM) was used for predictions of future fire risk conditions. The experiment was conducted under two tree dispersal scenarios: the status quo scenario, in which the distribution of forest types does not differ from the present one, and the unlimited dispersal scenario, which allows forest types to expand their range to fully occupy their climatic niche. Our results show that future warming will create climate conditions that are more prone to fire occurrence. However, unlimited dispersal of southern restricted deciduous species could reduce the impact of climate change on future fire occurrence. Hence, the use of deciduous species could be a good option for an efficient strategic fire mitigation strategy aimed at reducing fire propagation in coniferous landscapes and increasing public safety in remote populated areas of eastern boreal Canada under climate change.},

  abstract = {Recent changes in the seasonal timing (phenology) of familiar biological events have been one of the most conspicuous signs of climate change. However, the lack of a standardized approach to analysing change has hampered assessment of consistency in such changes among different taxa and trophic levels and across freshwater, terrestrial and marine environments. We present a standardized assessment of 25 532 rates of phenological change for 726 UK terrestrial, freshwater and marine taxa. The majority of spring and summer events have advanced, and more rapidly than previously documented. Such consistency is indicative of shared large scale drivers. Furthermore, average rates of change have accelerated in a way that is consistent with observed warming trends. Less coherent patterns in some groups of organisms point to the agency of more local scale processes and multiple drivers. For the first time we show a broad scale signal of differential phenological change among trophic levels; across environments advances in timing were slowest for secondary consumers, thus heightening the potential risk of temporal mismatch in key trophic interactions. If current patterns and rates of phenological change are indicative of future trends, future climate warming may exacerbate trophic mismatching, further disrupting the functioning, persistence and resilience of many ecosystems and having a major impact on ecosystem services.},

Work on simplified ecosystems in which the diversity of a single trophic level is manipulated shows that diversity can enhance ecosystem processes such as primary productivity and nutrient retention. Theory also strongly suggests that biodiversity can act as biological insurance against potential disruptions caused by environmental changes. However, these studies generally concern a single trophic level, primary producers for the most part. Changes in biodiversity also affect ecosystem functioning through trophic interactions. Here we review, through the analysis of a simple ecosystem model, several key aspects inherent in multitrophic systems that may strongly affect the relationship between diversity and ecosystem processes. Our analysis shows that trophic interactions have a strong impact on the relationships between diversity and ecosystem functioning, whether the ecosystem property considered is total biomass or temporal variability of biomass at the various trophic levels. In both cases, food-web structure and trade-offs that affect interaction strength have major effects on these relationships. Multitrophic interactions are expected to make biodiversity\textendash{}ecosystem functioning relationships more complex and non-linear, in contrast to the monotonic changes predicted for simplified systems with a single trophic level.},

  abstract = {The ongoing changes to climate challenge the conservation of forest biodiversity. Yet, in thermally limited systems, such as temperate forests, not all species groups might be affected negatively. Furthermore, simultaneous changes in the disturbance regime have the potential to mitigate climate-related impacts on forest species. Here, we (i) investigated the potential long-term effect of climate change on biodiversity in a mountain forest landscape, (ii) assessed the effects of different disturbance frequencies, severities and sizes and (iii) identified biodiversity hotspots at the landscape scale to facilitate conservation management. We employed the model iLand to dynamically simulate the tree vegetation on 13 865 ha of the Kalkalpen National Park in Austria over 1000 years, and investigated 36 unique combinations of different disturbance and climate scenarios. We used simulated changes in tree cover and composition as well as projected temperature and precipitation to predict changes in the diversity of Araneae, Carabidae, ground vegetation, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Mollusca, saproxylic beetles, Symphyta and Syrphidae, using empirical response functions. Our findings revealed widely varying responses of biodiversity indicators to climate change. Five indicators showed overall negative effects, with Carabidae, saproxylic beetles and tree species diversity projected to decrease by more than 33\%. Six indicators responded positively to climate change, with Hymenoptera, Mollusca and Syrphidae diversity projected to increase more than twofold. Disturbances were generally beneficial for the studied indicators of biodiversity. Our results indicated that increasing disturbance frequency and severity have a positive effect on biodiversity, while increasing disturbance size has a moderately negative effect. Spatial hotspots of biodiversity were currently found in low- to mid-elevation areas of the mountainous study landscape, but shifted to higher-elevation zones under changing climate conditions. Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight that intensifying disturbance regimes may alleviate some of the impacts of climate change on forest biodiversity. However, the projected shift in biodiversity hotspots is a challenge for static conservation areas. In this regard, overlapping hotspots under current and expected future conditions highlight priority areas for robust conservation management.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem multifunctionality, the simultaneous production of multiple e\- cosystem functions, depends on community diversity, composition, productivity, and spatial scale. In metacommunities, each of these community properties is affected by how species disperse \-between local patches to track environmental change. Here we use a consumer\textendash{}resource m\- etacommunity model of resource competition to show how dispersal affects the link between d\- iversity, composition, and ecosystem multifunctionality. When species differ in their functional traits and environmental niche, metacommunity multifunctionality becomes highly \-dependent upon dispersal, which allows community diversity to be maintained when environmental conditions change. Dispersal promotes multifunctionality in two ways: (1) species \-sorting, whereby species track local environmental changes by shifting in space, thus preserving diversity and ensuring high biomass productivity, and (2) mass effects, whereby source\textendash{}sink dynamics allow species to persist in suboptimal environments, thus increasing local diversity. Changing the rate at which species disperse affects the strength of these metacommunity \-processes, and so metacommunity multifunctionality exhibits a unimodal relationship with dispersal, peaking when dispersal is intermediate. Species-s\- orting dynamics also provide s\- patial insurance whereby compensatory dynamics stabilize the fluctuations of each function through time at the regional scale. However, this does not extend to the local scale, where species sorting results in high temporal variability for each function, even though the overall rates of multifunctionality are high. Our results suggest that metacommunity processes are important determinants of ecosystem multifunctionality, and thus effective management of multiple \-ecosystem functions requires consideration of landscape connectivity.},

  abstract = {The northeastern United States is a predominately-forested region that, like most of the eastern U.S., has undergone a 400-year history of intense logging, land clearance for agriculture, and natural reforestation. This setting affords the opportunity to address a major ecological question: How similar are today's forests to those existing prior to European colonization? Working throughout a nine-state region spanning Maine to Pennsylvania, we assembled a comprehensive database of archival land-survey records describing the forests at the time of European colonization. We compared these records to modern forest inventory data and described: (1) the magnitude and attributes of forest compositional change, (2) the geography of change, and (3) the relationships between change and environmental factors and historical land use. We found that with few exceptions, notably the American chestnut, the same taxa that made up the pre-colonial forest still comprise the forest today, despite ample opportunities for species invasion and loss. Nonetheless, there have been dramatic shifts in the relative abundance of forest taxa. The magnitude of change is spatially clustered at local scales ({$<$}125 km) but exhibits little evidence of regional-scale gradients. Compositional change is most strongly associated with the historical extent of agricultural clearing. Throughout the region, there has been a broad ecological shift away from late successional taxa, such as beech and hemlock, in favor of early- and mid-successional taxa, such as red maple and poplar. Additionally, the modern forest composition is more homogeneous and less coupled to local climatic controls.},

Despite potential negative effects on biodiversity, salvage logging is often conducted, even in areas otherwise excluded from logging and reserved for nature conservation, inter alia because strategic priorities for post-disturbance management are widely lacking. A review of the existing literature revealed that most studies investigating the effects of salvage logging on biodiversity have been conducted less than 5~years following natural disturbances, and focused on non-saproxylic organisms. A meta-analysis across 24 species groups revealed that salvage logging significantly decreases numbers of species of eight taxonomic groups. Richness of dead wood dependent taxa (i.e. saproxylic organisms) decreased more strongly than richness of non-saproxylic taxa. In contrast, taxonomic groups typically associated with open habitats increased in the number of species after salvage logging. By analysing 134 original species abundance matrices, we demonstrate that salvage logging significantly alters community composition in 7 of 17 species groups, particularly affecting saproxylic assemblages. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that salvage logging is not consistent with the management objectives of protected areas. Substantial changes, such as the retention of dead wood in naturally disturbed forests, are needed to support biodiversity. Future research should investigate the amount and spatio-temporal distribution of retained dead wood needed to maintain all components of biodiversity.},

Most prior research has focussed on the impacts of partial harvesting on biological diversity, while stand dynamic responses remain little studied. In this paper we explore partial stand harvesting in the Canadian boreal\textemdash{}its rationale, current extent, and impact on stand dynamic patterns. Empirical studies from the boreal and elsewhere indicate that residual trees of many species respond to partial harvesting with enhanced growth, commonly showing a lagged response after which peak growth occurs five to 25 years following harvest. Post-harvest mortality is also prevalent but much more variable, with losses of residual trees ranging from nearly zero to more than 50\% above background mortality rates in the initial years following harvest. With the exception of strip cutting in parts of northern Ontario and Quebec (HARP/CPPTM), operational partial harvesting in the Canadian boreal currently involves very low levels of retention. Available data suggest that such low retention levels, particularly when spatially dispersed, generally result in unacceptably high rates of post-harvest mortality, which are unlikely to be offset by increases in residual tree growth. There is an urgent need for development of spatially explicit stand simulation models that will allow accurate yield predictions for partial harvest systems to assess their feasibility in boreal forest management.},

  abstract = {The demand for projections of the future distribution of biodiversity has triggered an upsurge in modelling at the crossroads between ecology and evolution. Despite the enthusiasm around these so-called biodiversity models, most approaches are still criticised for not integrating key processes known to shape species ranges and community structure. Developing an integrative modelling framework for biodiversity distribution promises to improve the reliability of predictions and to give a better understanding of the eco-evolutionary dynamics of species and communities under changing environments. In this article, we briefly review some eco-evolutionary processes and interplays among them, which are essential to provide reliable projections of species distributions and community structure. We identify gaps in theory, quantitative knowledge and data availability hampering the development of an integrated modelling framework. We argue that model development relying on a strong theoretical foundation is essential to inspire new models, manage complexity and maintain tractability. We support our argument with an example of a novel integrated model for species distribution modelling, derived from metapopulation theory, which accounts for abiotic constraints, dispersal, biotic interactions and evolution under changing environmental conditions. We hope such a perspective will motivate exciting and novel research, and challenge others to improve on our proposed approach.},

Answering this question requires framing an analysis on the frontier between species distribution modelling (SDM), which ignores biotic interactions and dispersal limitation, and community ecology, which provides specific predictions on community and meta-community structure and resulting diversity patterns such as species richness and functional diversity. Using both empirical and simulated datasets, we tested whether predicted occurrences from fine-resolution SDMs provide good estimates of community structure and diversity patterns at resolutions ranging from a resolution typical of studies within reserves (250 m) to that typical of a regional biodiversity study (5 km). For both datasets, we show that the imprint of biotic interactions and dispersal limitation quickly vanishes when spatial resolution is reduced, which demonstrates the value of SDMs for tracking the imprint of community assembly processes across scales.},

Location The study area extends from 30\textdegree\,N to 80\textdegree\,N, covering three forest biomes \textendash{} temperate broadleaf and mixed forests (TBMF), temperate conifer forests (TCF) and boreal forests (BFT) \textendash{} over three continents (North America, Europe and Asia). Methods This study is based on a recently available growing stock volume (GSV) product retrieved from synthetic aperture radar data. Forest biomass and spatially explicit uncertainty estimates were derived from the GSV using existing databases of wood density and allometric relationships between biomass compartments (stem, branches, roots, foliage). We tested the resultant map against inventory-based biomass data from Russia, Europe and the USA prior to making intercontinent and interbiome carbon stock comparisons. Results Our derived carbon density map agrees well with inventory data at regional scales (r2\,=\,0.70\textendash{}0.90). While 40.7\,{$\pm$}\,15.7 petagram of carbon (Pg\,C) are stored in BFT, TBMF and TCF contain 24.5\,{$\pm$}\,9.4\,Pg\,C and 14.5\,{$\pm$}\,4.8 Pg\,C, respectively. In terms of carbon density, we found 6.21\,{$\pm$}\,2.07\,kg\,C m-2 retained in TCF and 5.80\,{$\pm$}\,2.21\,kg\,C m-2 in TBMF, whereas BFT have a mean carbon density of 4.00\,{$\pm$}\,1.54\,kg\,C m-2. Indications of a higher carbon density in Europe compared with the other continents across each of the three biomes could not be proved to be significant. Main conclusions The presented carbon density and corresponding uncertainty map give an insight into the spatial patterns of biomass and stand as a new benchmark to improve carbon cycle models and carbon monitoring systems. In total, we found 79.8\,{$\pm$}\,29.9\,Pg\,C stored in northern boreal and temperate forests, with Asian BFT accounting for 22.1\,{$\pm$}\,8.3\,Pg\,C.},

Hundreds of studies spanning terrestrial, aquatic, and marine ecosystems show that high-diversity mixtures are approximately twice as productive as monocultures of the same species and that this difference increases through time. These impacts of higher diversity have multiple causes, including interspecific complementarity, greater use of limiting resources, decreased herbivory and disease, and nutrient-cycling feedbacks that increase nutrient stores and supply rates over the long term. These experimentally observed effects of diversity are consistent with predictions based on a variety of theories that share a common feature: All have trade-off-based mechanisms that allow long-term coexistence of many different competing species. Diversity loss has an effect as great as, or greater than, the effects of herbivory, fire, drought, nitrogen addition, elevated CO2, and other drivers of environmental change. The preservation, conservation, and restoration of biodiversity should be a high global priority.},

While much evidence supports temperature-driven range shifts, there is substantial heterogeneity in species' responses that remains poorly understood. We resampled breeding ranges of birds across three elevational transects in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, USA, that were extensively surveyed in the early 20th century. Presence\textendash{}absence comparisons were made at 77 sites and occupancy models were used to separate significant range shifts from artifacts of false absences. Over the past century, rising temperature pushed species upslope while increased precipitation pulled them downslope, resulting in range shifts that were heterogeneous within species and among regions. While 84\% of species shifted their elevational distribution, only 51\% of upper or lower range boundary shifts were upslope. By comparison, 82\% of range shifts were in a direction predicted by changes in either temperature or precipitation. Species were significantly more likely to shift elevational ranges than their ecological counterparts if they had small clutch sizes, defended all-purpose territories, and were year-round residents, results that were in opposition to a priori predictions from dispersal-related hypotheses. Our results illustrate the complex interplay between species-specific and region-specific factors that structure patterns of breeding range change over long time periods. Future projections of increasing temperature and highly variable precipitation regimes create a strong potential for heterogeneous responses by species at range margins.},

A number of ecological models have been proposed over the last decades to develop these biodiversity scenarios. Novel modelling approaches with strong theoretical foundation now offer the possibility to integrate key ecological and evolutionary processes that shape species distribution and community structure. Although biodiversity is affected by multiple threats, most studies addressing the effects of future environmental changes on biodiversity focus on a single threat only. We examined the studies published during the last 25 years that developed scenarios to predict future biodiversity changes based on climate, land-use and landcover change projections. We found that biodiversity scenarios mostly focus on the future impacts of climate change and largely neglect changes in land use and land cover. The emphasis on climate change impacts has increased over time and has now reached a maximum. Yet, the direct destruction and degradation of habitats through land-use and land-cover changes are among the most significant and immediate threats to biodiversity. We argue that the current state of integration between ecological and land system sciences is leading to biased estimation of actual risks and therefore constrains the implementation of forward-looking policy responses to biodiversity decline. We suggest research directions at the crossroads between ecological and environmental sciences to face the challenge of developing interoperable and plausible projections of future environmental changes and to anticipate the full range of their potential impacts on biodiversity. An intergovernmental platform is needed to stimulate such collaborative research efforts and to emphasize the societal and political relevance of taking up this challenge.},

  abstract = {Sometimes, we stumble over literature revealing that well-known and groundbreaking theories have previously been proposed by earlier researchers. Going back to the 1920s and a group of Nordic botanists, we discovered that they had already accomplished much of what theoretical ecologists and biographers, especially Americans, did half a century later. In order to restore their legacy and understand why the work of the early spatial ecologists in Scandinavia and Finland was forgotten, we examined their publications, recalculated some of their results from their original data and compared these to the more recent independent discoveries of these theories. These Nordic early 20th-century botanists worked with sample areas (mainlands) as well as island systems, examining spatial patterns and foreseeing or even building probabilistic approaches to species\textendash{}area relationships (SARs), occupancy-frequency distributions (OFDs) and species-to-genus (S/G) ratios. Many theories in spatial ecology and biogeography are linked to the SAR, such as MacArthur and Wilson's equilibrium theory of island biogeography (based on colonization and extinction), Darlington's rule of thumb, Preston's canonical hypothesis, Diamond's rules of reserve design, and Coleman's random-placement theory. However, many of the most important SAR-based theories\textemdash{}as the mathematical shape of both mainland and island SARs as well as rules of thumb, colonization rates on islands, and the random-placement theory\textemdash{}had already been discovered or discussed in the 1920s by members of the Stockholm group which included the Swedes Gunnar Romell, Olof Arrhenius, Harald Kylin, and The Svedberg, and a Finn, Widar Brenner. The notion of stochastic S/G ratios and the idea that distance affects colonization rates can be traced back to another Finn, Alvar Palmgren. Great theories like these may disappear, if they are, as these, buried in obscure journals or written in languages other than English. There was also almost no audience in the 1920s and 30s, as mathematical theories were less acceptable at that time. Perhaps even more importantly, a devastating dispute (``The Great Polemic'') arose between the Stockholm group of theoretically and mathematically inclined botanists and the Uppsala group of descriptive phytosociologists. The fight, in which the Uppsala group won, was more a political and sociological than an intellectual one. As a result, not only the budding discipline of spatial ecology faded into oblivion but also the researchers were lost to science, at least to spatial ecology and biogeography, and descriptive and taxonomic approaches came to dominate Nordic ecology right up to the 1960s.},

After 4 years of growth, most mixtures did not differ in productivity from the averages of their respective monocultures, but some did overyield significantly.

  abstract = {Rewilding is a developing concept in ecosystem stewardship that involves reorganizing and regenerating wildness in an ecologically degraded landscape, with present and future ecosystem function being of higher consideration than historical benchmark conditions. This approach differs from ecosystem restoration but the two concepts are often conflated because (a) they both rely on similar management actions (at least initially) and (b) it can be erroneously assumed that they both aim for similar states of wildness. Rewilding and restoring both influence biodiversity, and common management actions such as species reintroductions (e.g. beavers or wolves) can be integral to a rewilding project. However, in contrast with restoration, rewilding has lower fidelity to taxonomic precedent and promotes taxonomic substitutions for extinct native species that once underpinned the delivery of key ecological functions. We suggest the adaptive cycle as the appropriate conceptual framework in which to distinguish rewilding from ecosystem restoration. The focus of restoration ecology is to return an ecosystem to as close to its former state as is possible after a major disturbance, by directly reinstating it on the `foreloop' of the adaptive cycle. In contrast, rewilding draws from the `backloop' by promoting reorganization and redevelopment of the ecosystem under changing environmental conditions. If environmental conditions have changed so significantly that a regime shift is inevitable, then rewilding can facilitate the development of a novel ecosystem to sustain the provision of ecosystem services. Synthesis and applications. Rewilding and restoring both have their places in biodiversity conservation. In each case, their respective merits should be weighed in relation to stakeholder priorities, prevailing and predicted environmental conditions, the level of biological organization targeted for management, and existing and future management capacity. We provide simple schematic decision-pathways to assist in exploring whether an ecologically degraded landscape might be a candidate for restoration, active rewilding, or passive rewilding.},

Here we investigated the pollination interactions in the two most disturbed Gala\textasciiacute{} pagos Islands, comparing the three main habitats and the two seasons, and assessing the impacts of alien plant invasions on network structure. We found that the pollination network structure was rather consistent between the two islands, but differed across habitats and seasons. Overall, the arid zone had the largest networks and highest species generalization levels whereas either the transition between habitats or the humid habitat showed lower values. Our data suggest that alien plants integrate easily into the communities, but with low impact on overall network structure, except for an increase in network selectiveness. The humid zone showed the highest nestedness and the lowest modularity, which might be explained by the low species diversity and the higher incidence of alien plants in this habitat. Both pollinators and plants were also more generalized in the hot season, when networks showed to be more nested. Alien species (both plants and pollinators) represented a high fraction ( 56 \%) of the total number of interactions in the networks. It is thus likely that, in spite of the overall weak effect we found of alien plant invasion on pollination network structure, these introduced species influence the reproductive success of native ones, and by doing so, they affect the functioning of the community. This certainly deserves further investigation.},

Such models do not usually represent important processes explicitly related to climate change and harvesting, which limits their potential for predicting and understanding the future of boreal bird assemblages at the landscape scale. In this study, we attempted to assess the cumulative and specific impacts of both harvesting and climate-induced changes on wildfires and standlevel processes (e.g., reproduction, growth) in the boreal forest of eastern Canada. The projected changes in these landscape- and stand-scale processes (referred to as ``drivers of change'') were then assessed for their impacts on future habitats and potential productivity of black-backed woodpecker (BBWO; Picoides arcticus), a focal species representative of deadwood and old-growth biodiversity in eastern Canada. Forest attributes were simulated using a forest landscape model, LANDIS-II, and were used to infer future landscape suitability to BBWO under three anthropogenic climate forcing scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), compared to the historical baseline. We found climate change is likely to be detrimental for BBWO, with up to 92\% decline in potential productivity under the worst-case climate forcing scenario (RCP 8.5). However, large declines were also projected under baseline climate, underlining the importance of harvest in determining future BBWO productivity. Present-day harvesting practices were the single most important cause of declining areas of old-growth coniferous forest, and hence appeared as the single most important driver of future BBWO productivity, regardless of the climate scenario. Climate-induced increases in fire activity would further promote young, deciduous stands at the expense of old-growth coniferous stands. This suggests that the biodiversity associated with deadwood and old-growth boreal forests may be greatly altered by the cumulative impacts of natural and anthropogenic disturbances under a changing climate. Management adaptations, including reduced harvesting levels and strategies to promote coniferous species content, may help mitigate these cumulative impacts.},

  abstract = {Under the current scenario of rapid human population increase, achieving efficient and productive agricultural land use while conserving biodiversity is a global challenge. There is an ongoing debate whether land for nature and for production should be segregated (land sparing) or integrated on the same land (land sharing, wildlife-friendly farming). While recent studies argue for agricultural intensification in a land sparing approach, we suggest here that it fails to account for real-world complexity. We argue that agriculture practiced under smallholder farmer-dominated landscapes and not large-scale farming, is currently the backbone of global food security in the developing world. Furthermore, contemporary food usage is inefficient with one third wasted and a further third used inefficiently to feed livestock and that conventional intensification causes often overlooked environmental costs. A major argument for wildlife friendly farming and agroecological intensification is that crucial ecosystem services are provided by ``planned'' and ``associated'' biodiversity, whereas the land sparing concept implies that biodiversity in agroecosystems is functionally negligible. However, loss of biological control can result in dramatic increases of pest densities, pollinator services affect a third of global human food supply, and inappropriate agricultural management can lead to environmental degradation. Hence, the true value of functional biodiversity on the farm is often inadequately acknowledged or understood, while conventional intensification tends to disrupt beneficial functions of biodiversity. In conclusion, linking agricultural intensification with biodiversity conservation and hunger reduction requires well-informed regional and targeted solutions, something which the land sparing vs sharing debate has failed to achieve so far.},

Yet, there is relatively little work in economics that addresses biodiversity loss. Some economists have called for better integration of economic and ecological models to address biodiversity and the attendant ecosystem services. Current integrated approaches in economics are discussed, and they take in ecosystem services, ecosystem externalities, and substantial ecological modeling. Much of the modeling uses Lotka-Volterra equations, which are standard in ecology, although there is concern that the equations lack the microfoundations of plant and animal behavior. An alternative approach is to admit microbehavior using economic optimization techniques that build adaptive ecological systems. However, much more effort is needed to assess whether admitting more ecological detail into economic models will be fruitful.},

This paper synthesizes current understanding of disturbance with an emphasis on fundamental contributions to contemporary landscape and ecosystem ecology, then identifies future research priorities. Studies of disturbance led to insights about heterogeneity, scale, and thresholds in space and time and catalyzed new paradigms in ecology. Because they create vegetation patterns, disturbances also establish spatial patterns of many ecosystem processes on the landscape. Drivers of global change will produce new spatial patterns, altered disturbance regimes, novel trajectories of change, and surprises. Future disturbances will continue to provide valuable opportunities for studying pattern\textendash{}process interactions. Changing disturbance regimes will produce acute changes in ecosystems and ecosystem services over the short (years to decades) and long term (centuries and beyond). Future research should address questions related to (1) disturbances as catalysts of rapid ecological change, (2) interactions among disturbances, (3) relationships between disturbance and society, especially the intersection of land use and disturbance, and (4) feedbacks from disturbance to other global drivers. Ecologists should make a renewed and concerted effort to understand and anticipate the causes and consequences of changing disturbance regimes. Monica G. Turner, MacArthur Award Recipient, 2008},

Further, the extent to which network metrics characterise the spatiotemporally-variable dynamic structure of interacting communities is unknown. Here, we summarise the attributes of web structure that are predicted to confer stability or increased function to a system, as these may be of greatest interest to conservation biologists. However, empirical evaluation of these effects is lacking in most cases, and we discuss whether stability is even desirable in all contexts. The incorporation of web attributes into conservation monitoring requires that changes in these attributes can be recorded (sampled) with relative ease. We contrast the sensitivity of metrics to sampling effort, and highlight those (such as nestedness and connectance) that could easily be incorporated into conservation monitoring. Despite our growing understanding of the characteristics of food webs that confer stability and function, numerous practical challenges need to be overcome before the goal of conserving species interaction networks can be achieved.},

In this review, we synthesize data from 688 published studies to show that these drivers often alter competitive interactions among plants and animals, exert multitrophic effects on the decomposer food web, increase intensity of pathogen infection, weaken mutualisms involving plants, and enhance herbivory while having variable effects on predation. A recurrent finding is that there is substantial variability among studies in both the magnitude and direction of effects of any given GEC driver on any given type of biotic interaction. Further, we show that higher order effects among multiple drivers acting simultaneously create challenges in predicting future responses to global environmental change, and that extrapolating these complex impacts across entire networks of species interactions yields unanticipated effects on ecosystems. Finally, we conclude that in order to reliably predict the effects of GEC on community and ecosystem processes, the greatest single challenge will be to determine how biotic and abiotic context alters the direction and magnitude of GEC effects on biotic interactions.},

Competition and dispersal differences decreased diversity and produced so-called `no-analogue' communities, defined as a novel combination of species that does not currently co-occur. Climate change altered community richness the most when species had narrow niches, when mean community-wide dispersal rates were low and when species differed in dispersal abilities. With high interspecific dispersal variance, the best dispersers tracked climate change, out-competed slower dispersers and caused their extinction. Overall, competition slowed the advance of colonists into newly suitable habitats, creating lags in climate tracking. We predict that climate change will most threaten communities of species that have narrow niches (e.g. tropics), vary in dispersal (most communities) and compete strongly. Current forecasts probably underestimate climate change impacts on biodiversity by neglecting competition and dispersal differences.},

Recently, network applications have erupted in many fields, and graph models are now being applied in landscape ecology and conservation biology, particularly for applications couched in metapopulation theory. In these applications, graph nodes represent habitat patches or local populations and links indicate functional connections among populations (i.e. via dispersal). Graphs are models of more complicated real systems, and so it is appropriate to review these applications from the perspective of modelling in general. Here we review recent applications of network theory to habitat patches in landscape mosaics. We consider (1) the conceptual model underlying these applications; (2) formalization and implementation of the graph model; (3) model parameterization; (4) model testing, insights, and predictions available through graph analyses; and (5) potential implications for conservation biology and related applications. In general, and for a variety of ecological systems, we find the graph model a remarkably robust framework for applications concerned with habitat connectivity. We close with suggestions for further work on the parameterization and validation of graph models, and point to some promising analytic insights.},

Vector-based maps delineate land cover types as polygons, while raster lattices represent the landscape as a grid. Here we adopt a third lattice data structure, the graph. A graph represents a landscape as a set of nodes (e.g., habitat patches) connected to some degree by edges that join pairs of nodes functionally (e.g., via dispersal). Graph theory is well developed in other fields, including geography (transportation networks, routing applications, siting problems) and computer science (circuitry and network optimization). We present an overview of basic elements of graph theory as it might be applied to issues of connectivity in heterogeneous landscapes, focusing especially on applications of metapopulation theory in conservation biology. We develop a general set of analyses using a hypothetical landscape mosaic of habitat patches in a nonhabitat matrix. Our results suggest that a simple graph construct, the minimum spanning tree, can serve as a powerful guide to decisions about the relative importance of individual patches to overall landscape connectivity. We then apply this approach to an actual conservation scenario involving the threatened Mexican Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis lucida). Simulations with an incidencefunction metapopulation model suggest that population persistence can be maintained despite substantial losses of habitat area, so long as the minimum spanning tree is protected. We believe that graph theory has considerable promise for applications concerned with connectivity and ecological flows in general. Because the theory is already well developed in other disciplines, it might be brought to bear immediately on pressing ecological applications in conservation biology and landscape ecology.},

  abstract = {Abstract The enemy release hypothesis is frequently invoked to explain invasion by nonnative species, but studies focusing on the influence of enemies on natural plant range expansion due to climate change remain scarce. We combined multiple approaches to study the influence of plant?enemy interactions on the upper elevational range limit of sugar maple (Acer saccharum) in southeastern Qu{\'e}bec, Canada, where a previous study had demonstrated intense seed predation just beyond the range limit. Consistent with the hypothesis of release from natural enemies at the range limit, data from both natural patterns of regeneration and from seed and seedling transplant experiments showed higher seedling densities at the range edge than in the core of the species' distribution. A growth chamber experiment manipulating soil origin and temperature indicated that this so-called ?happy edge? was not likely caused by temperature (i.e., the possibility that climate warming has made high elevation temperatures optimal for sugar maple) or by abiotic soil factors that vary along the elevational gradient. Finally, an insect-herbivore-exclusion experiment showed that insect herbivory was a major cause of seedling mortality in the core of sugar maple's distribution, whereas seedlings transplanted at or beyond the range edge experienced minimal herbivory (i.e., enemy release). Insect herbivory did not completely explain the high levels of seedling mortality in the core of the species' distribution, suggesting that seedlings at or beyond the range edge may also experience release from pathogens. In sum, while some effects of enemies are magnified beyond range edges (e.g., seed predation), others are dampened at and beyond the range edge (e.g., insect herbivory), such that understanding the net outcome of different biotic interactions within, at and beyond the edge of distribution is critical to predicting species' responses to global change.},

Methods We analysed presence\textendash{}absence data using two successive surveys of the Spanish Forest Inventory in five Fagaceae tree species (two temperate: Fagus sylvatica and Quercus petraea, one sub-Mediterranean: Q. faginea and two Mediterranean: Q. suber and Q. ilex) in two mountain ranges (the Pyrenees and the Iberian system). Half of the fitted altitudinal distributions were skewed and required use of an asymmetric model for unbiased estimates of optimum altitude and changes in the probability of presence along the altitudinal gradient. For each species and mountain range, shifts were considered to have occurred when the difference in optimum altitude was significant or when differences in probability of occurrence between the two surveys demonstrated the occurrence of colonization or extirpation events. Results Overall, depending on species and mountain range, shifts in optimum altitude ranged between -34 m and +181 m. The altitudinal distribution of the Mediterranean species at the core of their latitudinal distribution range presented no sign of change. For the temperate and sub-Mediterranean Fagaceae species, the patterns demonstrated the existence of distribution changes over a 10-yr period. The largest, although not statistically significant, upward shift in optimum altitude was observed for Q. petraea in the Iberian system. More interestingly, its distribution indicated colonization events at higher altitudes. For Q. faginea in the Pyrenees, the shift in optimum altitude was the second largest and statistically significant, and was associated with large extirpation events at the lower altitudes. No evidence of shifts was observed for F. sylvatica. Conclusion This work demonstrates that changes in altitudinal distribution could occur over a 10-yr time period for tree species located at the southern limit of their distribution, such as some temperate and sub-Mediterranean oaks, whereas no movement was detected for Mediterranean oaks in the core of their distribution area.},

The CLUMondo model provides an innovative approach for global land-use change modeling to support integrated assessments. Demands for goods and services are, in the model, supplied by a variety of land systems that are characterized by their land cover mosaic, the agricultural management intensity, and livestock. Land system changes are simulated by the model, driven by regional demand for goods and influenced by local factors that either constrain or promote land system conversion. A characteristic of the new model is the endogenous simulation of intensification of agricultural management versus expansion of arable land, and urban versus rural settlements expansion based on land availability in the neighborhood of the location. Model results for the OECD Environmental Outlook scenario show that allocation of increased agricultural production by either management intensification or area expansion varies both among and within world regions, providing useful insight into the land sparing versus land sharing debate. The land system approach allows the inclusion of different types of demand for goods and services from the land system as a driving factor of land system change. Simulation results are compared to observed changes over the 1970\textendash{}2000 period and projections of other global and regional land change models.},

Species shift range individually, and not all species shift range at the same time and rate. This variation causes community reorganization in both the old and new ranges. In terrestrial ecosystems, range shifts alter aboveground-belowground interactions, influencing species abundance, community composition, ecosystem processes and services, and feedbacks within communities and ecosystems. Thus, range shifts may result in no-analog communities where foundation species and community genetics play unprecedented roles, possibly leading to novel ecosystems. Long-distance dispersal can enhance the disruption of aboveground-belowground interactions of plants, herbivores, pathogens, symbiotic mutualists, and decomposer organisms. These effects are most likely stronger for latitudinal than for altitudinal range shifts. Disrupted aboveground-belowground interactions may have influenced historical postglacial range shifts as well. Assisted migration without considering aboveground-belowground interactions could enhance risks of such range shift\textendash{}induced invasions.},

Thus far, many studies assessing the ecological consequences of global change have focussed on single trophic levels. However, understanding these changes and predicting their consequences may benefit from unravelling how interactions between primary producers, primary, and secondary consumers (plants, herbivores and carnivores) are being affected. Conservation and restoration may be improved when assessing species and their interactions on appropriate scales, while acknowledging that above- and belowground biota are ecologically linked. Selection pressures on one species may depend on others, so that species loss means more for diversity than just loss of a single taxon. It may also result in the loss of other species of the same or different trophic levels and in the dilution, or even loss, of various selection pressures. We review a number of discussions on trophic interactions in a changing world in relation to (i) the scale of ecosystem response to environmental change with emphasis on the soil subsystem, (ii) the linkage of above- and belowground subsystems and (iii) natural selection and the stability of community structure and ecosystem functioning. We discuss the need to bring together isolated sub-disciplines of ecology in order to understand the implications of global changes for ecosystem processes.},

After tracking the fates of 21 338 trees in a network of old-growth forest plots in the Sierra Nevada of California, we found that mortality rate, but not the recruitment rate, increased significantly over the 22 years of measurement (1983\textendash{}2004). Mortality rates increased in both of two dominant taxonomic groups (Abies and Pinus) and in different forest types (different elevational zones). The increase in overall mortality rate resulted from an increase in tree deaths attributed to stress and biotic causes, and coincided with a temperature-driven increase in an index of drought. Our findings suggest that these forests (and by implication, other water-limited forests) may be sensitive to temperature-driven drought stress, and may be poised for die-back if future climates continue to feature rising temperatures without compensating increases in precipitation.},

Spatial factors that were separable from species composition explained 83\% and 51\% of the respective variation in growth and mortality. Moderate additional variation in mortality (26\%) was attributable to differences in species composition. Age-dependent biomass models showed that variation in forest biomass can be explained primarily by spatial gradients in growth that were unrelated to species composition. Species-dependent patterns of mortality explained additional variation in biomass, with forests supporting less biomass when dominated by species that are highly susceptible to competition (e.g. Populus spp.) or to biotic disturbances (e.g. Abies balsamea).},

  abstract = {The role of tree mortality in the global carbon balance is complicated by strong spatial and temporal heterogeneity that arises from the stochastic nature of carbon loss through disturbance. Characterizing spatio-temporal variation in mortality (including disturbance) and its effects on forest and carbon dynamics is thus essential to understanding the current global forest carbon sink, and to predicting how it will change in future. We analyzed forest inventory data from the eastern United States to estimate plot-level variation in mortality (relative to a long-term background rate for individual trees) for nine distinct forest regions. Disturbances that produced at least a fourfold increase in tree mortality over an approximately 5 year interval were observed in 1\textendash{}5\% of plots in each forest region. The frequency of disturbance was lowest in the northeast, and increased southwards along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts as fire and hurricane disturbances became progressively more common. Across the central and northern parts of the region, natural disturbances appeared to reflect a diffuse combination of wind, insects, disease, and ice storms. By linking estimated covariation in tree growth and mortality over time with a data-constrained forest dynamics model, we simulated the implications of stochastic variation in mortality for long-term aboveground biomass changes across the eastern United States. A geographic gradient in disturbance frequency induced notable differences in biomass dynamics between the least- and most-disturbed regions, with variation in mortality causing the latter to undergo considerably stronger fluctuations in aboveground stand biomass over time. Moreover, regional simulations showed that a given long-term increase in mean mortality rates would support greater aboveground biomass when expressed through disturbance effects compared with background mortality, particularly for early-successional species. The effects of increased tree mortality on carbon stocks and forest composition may thus depend partly on whether future mortality increases are chronic or episodic in nature.},

We analyse species distribution and abundance from about 33 000 forest inventory plots in Spain sampled twice over a period of 10\textendash{}12 years. We show a dominance of range contraction (extinction), and demographic decline over range expansion (colonization), with seven of 11 species exhibiting extinction downhill of their distribution. Contrary to expectations, these dynamics are not always consistent with climate warming over the study period, but result from legacies in forest structure due to past land use change and fire occurrence. We find that these changes have led to the expansion of broadleaf species (i.e. family Fagaceae) over areas formerly dominated by conifer species (i.e. family Pinaceae), due to the greater capacity of the former to respond to most disturbances and their higher competitive ability. This recent and rapid transition from conifers to broadleaves has important implications in forest dynamics and ecosystem services they provide. The finding raises the question as to whether the increasing dominance of relatively drought-sensitive broadleaf species will diminish resilience of Mediterranean forests to very likely drier conditions in the future.},

  abstract = {Aim Our study aimed to identify and explore the main factors that influence tree recruitment of multiple species at a regional scale across peninsular Spain, an understanding of which is essential for predicting future forest species composition in the face of ongoing environmental change. The study focused on the dynamics of the key transition phase from saplings to adult trees. Location The forests of peninsular Spain. Methods We used the extensive network of plots sampled in two consecutive Spanish national forest inventories ({$>$} 30,000 plots) to identify the factors that determine regeneration patterns of the 10 most abundant forest species of Spain at relatively large temporal (c. 10 years) and spatial scales (across Spain): five coniferous species of Pinus (pines) and five broadleaved species of the genera Fagus and Quercus. We fitted separate generalized linear models for the pine species and the broadleaved species to assess the response of sapling abundance and ingrowth rate to the spatial variability of climate (temperature, water availability and recent warming), forest structure (tree density, understorey and overstorey canopy cover, and basal area change) and disturbances (previous forest logging, wildfires and grazing). Results Mean sapling abundance was four times higher for broadleaved species than for pines, while mean annual ingrowth was twice as high. Sapling abundance and ingrowth rate were mainly determined by stand structure, both in pines and broadleaved trees. The direct effects of disturbances and climate were comparatively smaller, and there was no detectable effect of recent warming. Main conclusions The higher values of ingrowth rate of broadleaved species can be explained by their ability to maintain a higher sapling bank due to their greater shade tolerance. This differential response of pines and broadleaved species to canopy closure suggests a probable increase in broadleaved species at the expense of pines. This transition could occur earlier in stands with faster canopy closure dynamics. Spatially explicit, mixed-species demographic models incorporating both the ingrowth and the tree mortality components are needed for predicting the composition of future forests.},

In this paper we show, using data for North American mammals, that spatial extent can have a profound eVect both on the number and locations of the priority areas identiWed to attain a particular conservation goal. For example, applying the same selection target to obtaining just a single representation of each species, the numbers of areas required increased by approximately an order of magnitude between treating North America as a single unit and treating the provinces separately. Although this scenario is undoubtedly extremely simplistic, such large diVerences are maintained with greater occurrence targets. Balancing the beneWts and disadvantages of conservation planning at diVerent spatial extents is not straightforward. However, a multi-scale approach that exploits the respective beneWts and downplays the disadvantages when focussing on smaller or larger extents would seem valuable.},

We review the evidence on the impacts of increased climatic variability and extremes on physiological, ecological and evolutionary processes at multiple levels of biological organization, from individuals to populations and communities. Our review indicates that climatic variability can have profound influences on biological processes at multiple scales of organization. Responses to increased climatic variability and extremes are likely to be complex and cannot always be generalized, although our conceptual and methodological toolboxes allow us to make informed predictions about the likely consequences of such climatic changes. We conclude that climatic variability represents an important component of climate that deserves further attention.},

Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparing of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called 'loo' and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

However, at the most general level, patterns in the composition and diversity of species\textemdash{}the subject matter of community ecology\textemdash{}are influenced by only four classes of process: selection, drift, speciation, and dispersal. Selection represents deterministic fitness differences among species, drift represents stochastic changes in species abundance, speciation creates new species, and dispersal is the movement of organisms across space. All theoretical and conceptual models in community ecology can be understood with respect to their emphasis on these four processes. Empirical evidence exists for all of these processes and many of their interactions, with a predominance of studies on selection. Organizing the material of community ecology according to this framework can clarify the essential similarities and differences among the many conceptual and theoretical approaches to the discipline, and it can also allow for the articulation of a very general theory of community dynamics: species are added to communities via speciation and dispersal, and the relative abundances of these species are then shaped by drift and selection, as well as ongoing dispersal, to drive community dynamics.},

Trends in surface air temperature, precipitation, snow cover, and streamflow indices are examined along with the potential impact of lowfrequency variability related to large-scale atmospheric and oceanic oscillations on these trends. The results show that temperature has increased significantly in most regions of Canada over the period 1948\textendash{}2012, with the largest warming occurring in winter and spring. Precipitation has also increased, especially in the north. Changes in other climate and hydroclimatic variables, including a decrease in the amount of precipitation falling as snow in the south, fewer days with snow cover, an earlier start of the spring high-flow season, and an increase in April streamflow, are consistent with the observed warming and precipitation trends. For the period 1900\textendash{}2012, there are sufficient temperature and precipitation data for trend analysis for southern Canada (south of 608N) only. During this period, temperature has increased significantly across the region, precipitation has increased, and the amount of precipitation falling as snow has decreased in many areas south of 558N. The results also show that modes of low-frequency variability modulate the spatial distribution and strength of the trends; however, they alone cannot explain the observed long-term trends in these climate variables.},

Over the last three decades, developments in community and ecosystem ecology have forced the concept of trait beyond these original boundaries, and trait-based approaches are now widely used in studies ranging from the level of organisms to that of ecosystems. Despite some attempts to fix the terminology, especially in plant ecology, there is currently a high degree of confusion in the use, not only of the term ``trait'' itself, but also in the underlying concepts it refers to. We therefore give an unambiguous definition of plant trait, with a particular emphasis on functional trait. A hierarchical perspective is proposed, extending the ``performance paradigm'' to plant ecology. ``Functional traits'' are defined as morpho-physio-phenological traits which impact fitness indirectly via their effects on growth, reproduction and survival, the three components of individual performance. We finally present an integrative framework explaining how changes in trait values due to environmental variations are translated into organismal performance, and how these changes may influence processes at higher organizational levels. We argue that this can be achieved by developing ``integration functions'' which can be grouped into functional response (community level) and effect (ecosystem level) algorithms.},

However, the most cost-efficient conservation plan can be very dissimilar to any other plan achieving the set of conservation objectives. This is problematic under conditions of implementation uncertainty (e.g., if all or part of the plan becomes unattainable). We determined through simulations of parallel implementation of conservation plans and habitat loss the conditions under which optimal plans have limited chances of implementation and where implementation attempts would fail to meet objectives. We then devised a new, flexible method for identifying conservation priorities and scheduling conservation actions. This method entails generating a number of alternative plans, calculating the similarity in site composition among all plans, and selecting the plan with the highest density of neighboring plans in similarity space. We compared our method with the classic method that maximizes cost efficiency with synthetic and real data sets. When implementation was uncertain\textemdash{}a common reality\textemdash{}our method provided higher likelihood of achieving conservation targets. We found that {$\chi$} , a measure of the shortfall in objectives achieved by a conservation plan if the plan could not be implemented entirely, was the main factor determining the relative performance of a flexibility enhanced approach to conservation prioritization. Our findings should help planning authorities prioritize conservation efforts in the face of uncertainty about future condition and availability of sites.},

  abstract = {While phenological shifts and migration of isolated species under climate change have already been observed on alpine summits, very few studies have focused on community composition changes in subalpine grasslands. Here we use permanent plots monitored since 1954 and precisely located phytosociological censuses from 1970 to study compositional changes of subalpine grasslands in two distinct regions of the Swiss Northern Alps. In both areas, warming trends during the monitoring period were associated with changes in land management (abandonment of goat and sheep pasturing or grazing replaced by mowing). Old and recent inventories were compared with correspondence analyses (CA). Ecological indicator values, community-affinities and biological traits of the species were used to infer the factors responsible for triggering the observed changes. In both regions, subalpine grasslands were stable with smaller changes than have previously been observed in alpine environments. Only a few species appeared or disappeared and changes were generally limited to increasing or decreasing frequency and cover of certain taxa. At one site, grazing abandonment favored fallow species. Some of these species were located at their upper altitudinal distribution limits and may have spread because of rising temperatures. In both areas, declining species were predominantly alpine and low-growing species; their decline was probably due to increased competition (e.g., shadow) with more vigorous subalpine taxa no longer limited by grazing. We conclude that vegetation communities can respond rapidly to warming as long as colonization is facilitated by available space or structural change. In the subalpine grasslands studies, changes were mainly driven by land management. These communities have a dense vegetation cover and newly arriving herbaceous species preferring warmer conditions may take some time to establish themselves. However, climate disturbances, such as exceptional drought, may accelerate community changes by opening gaps for new species.},

  abstract = {The concept of resilience has evolved considerably since Holling's (1973) seminal paper. Different interpretations of what is meant by resilience, however, cause confusion. Resilience of a system needs to be considered in terms of the attributes that govern the system's dynamics. Three related attributes of social\textendash{}ecological systems (SESs) determine their future trajectories: resilience, adaptability, and transformability. Resilience (the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks) has four components\textemdash{}latitude, resistance, precariousness, and panarchy\textemdash{}most readily portrayed using the metaphor of a stability landscape. Adaptability is the capacity of actors in the system to influence resilience (in a SES, essentially to manage it). There are four general ways in which this can be done, corresponding to the four aspects of resilience. Transformability is the capacity to create a fundamentally new system when ecological, economic, or social structures make the existing system untenable.},

We derive analytic relationships under a limiting case; these results are extended to more general cases with numerical simulations. Our model shows that, while alpha diversity decreases local ecosystem variability, beta diversity generally contributes to increasing spatial asynchrony among local ecosystems. Consequently, both alpha and beta diversity provide stabilising effects for regional ecosystems, through local and spatial insurance effects respectively. We further show that at the regional scale, the stabilising effect of biodiversity increases as spatial environmental correlation increases. Our findings have important implications for understanding the interactive effects of global environmental changes (e.g. environmental homogenisation) and biodiversity loss on ecosystem sustainability at large scales.},

  abstract = {Most temperate forests in U.S. are recovering from heavy exploitation and are in intermediate successional stages where partial tree harvest is the primary disturbance. Changes in regional forest composition in response to climate change are often predicted for plant functional types using biophysical process models. These models usually simplify the simulation of succession and harvest and may not consider important species-specific demographic processes driving forests changes. We determined the relative importance of succession, harvest, and climate change to forest composition changes in a 125-million ha area of the Central Hardwood Forest Region of U.S. We used a forest landscape modeling approach to project changes in density and basal area of 23 tree species due to succession, harvest, and four climate scenarios from 2000 to 2300. On average, succession, harvest, and climate change explained 78, 17, and 1\% of the variation in species importance values (IV) at 2050, respectively, but their contribution changed to 46, 26, and 20\% by 2300. Climate change led to substantial increases in the importance of red maple and southern species (e.g., yellow-poplar) and decreases in northern species (e.g., sugar maple) and most of widely distributed species (e.g., white oak). Harvest interacted with climate change and accelerated changes in some species (e.g., increasing southern red oak and decreasing American beech) while ameliorated the changes for others (e.g., increasing red maple and decreasing white ash). Succession was the primary driver of forest composition change over the next 300 years. The effects of harvest on composition were more important than climate change in the short term but climate change became more important than harvest in the long term. Our results show that it is important to model species-specific responses when predicting changes in forest composition and structure in response to succession, harvest, and climate change.},

Phenological shifts can result in trophic asynchrony, population declines of higher-level consumers, and reduction of plant fitness. While timing of phenological events is often correlated with elevation, studies have shown that microclimates created by areas of heterogeneous topography can be decoupled from regional climate patterns and that the distribution of microclimates does not always follow the elevation gradient. To examine the interaction between regional weather patterns and microclimate, and the subsequent effect of microclimate on phenology, we conducted standardized weekly spring phenology surveys of 18 native forest plants at the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in the Western Cascades from 2009 to 2016. We saw a high degree of inter-annual variability of microclimate within and across sites, resulting in a changing pattern of microclimate diversity across the landscape from year to year. Most importantly, we saw that years with regional conditions predicted by continued climate change showed a loss of diversity in both microclimate and phenological events, with a more rapid advancement in bud break occurring at higher elevation sites. This study highlights the importance of understanding the interactions between regional and local processes that determine microclimate conditions and how those conditions influence patterns of plant phenology within forest communities, across mountain landscapes and over time, with implications for the capacity of mountainous regions to buffer local communities against the effects of climate change.},

  abstract = {About one-third of North America is forested. These forests are of incalculable value to human society in terms of harvested resources and ecosystem services and are sensitive to disturbance regimes. Epidemics of forest insects and diseases are the dominant sources of disturbance to North American forests. Here we review current understanding of climatic effects on the abundance of forest insects and diseases in North America, and of the ecological and socioeconomic impacts of biotic disturbances. We identified 27 insects (6 nonindigenous) and 22 diseases (9 nonindigenous) that are notable agents of disturbance in North American forests. The distribution and abundance of forest insects and pathogens respond rapidly to climatic variation due to their physiological sensitivity to temperature, high mobility, short generation times, and high reproductive potential. Additionally, climate affects tree defenses, tree tolerance, and community interactions involving enemies, competitors, and mutualists of insects and diseases. Recent research affirms the importance of milder winters, warmer growing seasons, and changes in moisture availability to the occurrence of biotic disturbances. Predictions from the first U.S. National Climate Assessment of expansions in forest disturbances from climate change have been upheld, in some cases more rapidly and dramatically than expected. Clear examples are offered by recent epidemics of spruce beetles in Alaska, mountain pine beetle in high-elevation five-needle pine forests of the Rocky Mountains, and southern pine beetle in the New Jersey Pinelands. Pathogens are less studied with respect to climate, but some are facilitated by warmer and wetter summer conditions. Changes in biotic disturbances have broad consequences for forest ecosystems and the services they provide to society. Climatic effects on forest insect and disease outbreaks may foster further changes in climate by influencing the exchange of carbon, water, and energy between forests and the atmosphere. Climate-induced changes in forest productivity and disturbance create opportunities as well as vulnerabilities (e.g., increases in productivity in many areas, and probably decreases in disturbance risks in some areas). There is a critical need to better understand and predict the interactions among climate, forest productivity, forest disturbance, and the socioeconomic relations between forests and people.},

  abstract = {Questions Which plant traits consistently respond to grazing in different years and across habitat-related environmental heterogeneity? Does the proposed partial RLQ approach allow partitioning of grazing-related environmental parameters from other environmental and temporal variations? Location Semi-arid savannas of central Namibia. Methods We recorded nine quantitative and 12 categorical traits from 87 plant species along grazing gradients in semi-arid Namibian rangelands. We sampled from gradients in different habitat settings in 2 yr with differing total rainfall amounts. We first examined trait\textendash{}environment relations with RLQ analysis. To remove confounding effects of temporal and habitat-related environmental variation on trait performance, we introduced a novel partial RLQ analysis approach. Furthermore, we used the fourth-corner statistic to quantify and test relations between traits, environmental factors and RLQ axes. Results Habitats and years had strong influences on trait patterns. After removing environmental variation caused by habitats and years, grazing became the most influential factor on trait responses. Traits negatively correlated with increasing grazing pressure were common to perennial grasses, such as long and entire leaves, anemochorous dispersal and rhizomatous growth. Positively correlated traits were those common to herbaceous, annual plants with a prostrate\textendash{}creeping habit, compound leaves, high specific leaf area (SLA) and exo- or endozoochorous dispersal. Some previously acknowledged grazing response traits, like growth form and plant height, were strongly influenced by variations in habitats and years and showed no significant correlation with grazing pressure. Conclusion We emphasize that some traits that respond to grazing may also vary under different habitat conditions and among years, especially in highly variable environments like semi-arid savannas. When analysing trait\textendash{}environment relations we recommend using approaches that partition environmental variation, particularly when applying broad sampling schemes at larger geographical scales.},

Understanding how tree seedlings respond to warming soil temperature is critical for predicting population recruitment in the future hardwood forests of northeastern North America, particularly as environmental conditions and thus optimal microhabitat availabilities change. We examined the effect of soil warming of 5 \textdegree{}C during the first growing season on germination, survival, phenology, growth, and stem and root biomass allocation in Acer rubrum L. (red maple) seedlings. While there was no effect of soil warming on germination or survival, seedlings growing in warmer soils demonstrated significantly accelerated leaf expansion, delayed autumn leaf senescence, and an extended leaf production period. Further, seedlings growing in warmer soils showed larger leaf area and stem and root structures at the end of the first growing season, with no evidence of biomass allocation trade-offs. Results suggest that A. rubrum seedlings can capitalize on soil warming by adjusting leaf phenology and leaf production, resulting in a longer period of carbon uptake and leading to higher overall biomass. The absence of growth allocation trade-offs suggests that A. rubrum will respond positively to increasing soil temperatures in northeastern forests, at least in the early life stages.},

  abstract = {People are living longer than ever before, and with this arises new complications and challenges for humanity. Among the most pressing of these challenges is of understanding the role of aging in the development of dementia. This paper is motivated by the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging data for 4742 subjects since 2004, and how it can be used to draw inference on the role of aging in the development of dementia. We construct a hidden Markov model (HMM) to represent progression of dementia from states associated with the buildup of amyloid plaque in the brain, and the loss of cortical thickness. A hierarchical Bayesian approach is taken to estimate the parameters of the HMM with a truly time-inhomogeneous infinitesimal generator matrix, and response functions of the continuous-valued biomarker measurements are cut-point agnostic. A Bayesian approach with these features could be useful in many disease progression models. Additionally, an approach is illustrated for correcting a common bias in delayed enrollment studies, in which some or all subjects are not observed at baseline. Standard software is incapable of accounting for this critical feature, so code to perform the estimation of the model described below is made available online.},

  abstract = {In studies of biodiversity, considerations of scale\textemdash{}the spatial or temporal domain to which data provide inference\textemdash{}are important because of the non-arithmetic manner in which species richness increases with area (and total abundance) and because fine-scale mechanisms (for example, recruitment, growth, and mortality of species) can interact with broad scale patterns (for example, habitat patch configuration) to influence dynamics in space and time. The key to understanding these dynamics is to consider patterns of environmental heterogeneity, including patterns produced by natural and anthropogenic disturbance. We studied how spatial variation in three aspects of biodiversity of terrestrial gastropods (species richness, species diversity, and nestedness) on the 16-ha Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot (LFDP) in a tropical forest of Puerto Rico was affected by disturbance caused by Hurricanes Hugo and Georges, as well as by patterns of historic land use. Hurricane-induced changes in spatial organization of species richness differed from those for species diversity. The gamma components of species richness changed after the hurricanes and were significantly different between Hurricanes Hugo and Georges. Alpha and two beta components of species richness, one related to turnover among sites within areas of similar land use and one related to variation among areas of different land use, varied randomly over time after both hurricanes. In contrast, gamma components of species diversity decreased in indistinguishable manners after both hurricanes, whereas the rates of change in the alpha component of species diversity differed between hurricanes. Beta components of diversity related to turnover among sites declined after both hurricanes in a consistent fashion. Those related to turnover among areas with different historic land uses varied stochastically. The immediate effect of hurricanes was to reduce nestedness of gastropod assemblages. Thereafter, nestedness increased during post-hurricane secondary succession, and did so in the same way, regardless of patterns of historic land use. The rates of change in degree of nestedness during secondary succession were different after each hurricane as a result of differences in the severity and extent of the hurricane-induced damage. Our analyses quantified temporal changes in the spatial organization of biodiversity of gastropod assemblages during forest recovery from hurricane-induced damage in areas that had experienced different patterns of historic human land use, and documented the dependence of biodiversity on spatial scale. We hypothesize that cross-scale interactions, likely those between the local demographics of species at the fine scale and the landscape configuration of patches at the broad scale, play a dominant role in affecting critical transfer processes, such as dispersal, and its interrelationship with aspects of biodiversity. Cross-scale interactions have significant implications for the conservation of biodiversity, as the greatest threats to biodiversity arise from habitat modification and fragmentation associated with disturbance arising from human activities.},

  abstract = {After decades focused on promoting economically valuable species, management of northern temperate forests has increasingly become focused on promoting tree species diversity. Unfortunately, many formerly common species that could contribute to diversity including yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britton.), paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh), eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis L.), and eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.) are now uncommon in the seedling layer, raising concerns about our ability to use these species to increase diversity. In this study, two related seed addition experiments conducted in 45 variably-sized harvest gaps (107\textendash{}3234m2) and four unharvested areas in Emmet County, Michigan, USA were used to investigate mechanisms potentially limiting seedling recruitment. The first experiment examined the influence of light (i.e. harvest gap size), competing vegetation, and deer browsing on seedling survival for three years in a 2\texttimes{}2 factorial, where subplots were unfenced or fenced to exclude deer, unclipped or clipped to control competing vegetation, and located across the gradient of gap sizes. The second experiment explored the influence of scarification, light, and competing vegetation on germination and subsequent survival for 2years in a 2\texttimes{}2 factorial, in subplots that were unscarified or scarified to remove litter, unclipped or clipped to control competing vegetation, and located across the gradient of gap sizes. Eastern hemlock, paper birch, and yellow birch, all smaller-seeded species, were 12, 17, and 95 times more abundant in scarified plots compared to unscarified plots. In contrast, white pine, the largest-seeded species, was unaffected by scarification and had low overall germination. Shade tolerant hemlock and shade intolerant paper birch germinated at higher densities in lower light, smaller harvest gap environments, while both mid-tolerant species, white pine and yellow birch, were unaffected by light. Increasing light availability had a positive influence on each species' first year survival except white pine, and also improved second year survival for paper birch and eastern hemlock. Paper birch and hemlock third year survival also increased with increasing light. By the end of the third growing season, only paper birch survival was negatively impacted by competition from vegetation and no species were affected by exposure to deer browse pressure. At the conclusion of the study, large group selection gaps (24\textendash{}50m diameter) contained the highest density of each species except white pine, suggesting that large group selection gaps may provide the best opportunity for reestablishing this particular group of species in the seedling layer.},

  abstract = {Variable hydrology of rivers strongly affects biophysical factors that influence primary production and population densities, thereby affecting the relative influence of bottom-up and top-down processes in trophic networks. Many tropical floodplain rivers have sustained seasonal flood pulses driven by precipitation patterns of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. These changes in flow alter concentrations of dissolved nutrients, aquatic primary productivity, and per-unit-area densities of aquatic organisms. Therefore, one would predict that the strength of top-down effects of animals on basal resources should shift as the annual flood pulse progresses. We conducted a series of field experiments in a Neotropical lowland river to test for effects of hydrologic phase, habitat (in-channel vs. floodplain aquatic habitat), and benthic-feeding fish and meiofauna on particulate organic matter, chlorophyll, and benthic microalgae. Net ecosystem productivity of this oligotrophic river is higher during the low phase of the annual flood cycle, which is also when resident fishes are at highest densities and there is a seasonal influx of migratory benthic-feeding fish. We therefore hypothesized that top-down effects of benthic-feeding fish would fluctuate temporally, with strongest effects during low water levels. We found that fish controlled the abundance of particulate organic matter and algae on solid substrates, but not on sand, during falling- and low-water phases within both channel and floodplain habitats. Except for diatom assemblages, which responded to fish exclusion, the taxonomic structure of algal and meiofauna assemblages was not significantly influenced by fish-exclusion treatments, but varied in relation to habitat type and hydrologic phase. Meiofauna densities were highest during the low-water period; experimental exclusion of meiofauna during this period had a significant effect on accumulation of particulate organic matter in sand. By controlling abundance of important basal resources, fishes and meiofauna have a large potential to influence other components of this tropical ecosystem. Our findings emphasize the predictable, gradual, changes in consumer\textendash{}resource interactions associated with the seasonal flood pulse in tropical river systems.},

However, the empirical order of species loss with respect to linkage has rarely been investigated. Furthermore, a species' linkage is a composite of its diet breadth and its abundance, yet the relative importance of these two factors in determining species loss order is poorly known. Here we explore the order of pollinator species loss in two contrasting study systems undergoing land-use intensification, using 120,000 pollinator specimens. We found that a pollinator species' linkage, as measured independently within plant-pollinator networks, positively predicted its persistence at human-disturbed sites in three of four analyses. The strongest predictor of persistence in all analyses was pollinator species abundance. In contrast, diet breadth poorly predicted persistence. Overall, our results suggest that community disassembly order buffers plant-pollinator networks against environmental change by retaining the highly linked species that make a disproportionate contribution to network robustness. Furthermore, these highly linked species likely persist because they are also the most common species, not because they are dietary generalists.},

  abstract = {A species' range can be thought of as a manifestation of the ecological niche in space. Within a niche, evolution has resulted in traits that maximize fitness. Across millennia, natural oscillations in temperature have caused shifts in the geographic location of appropriate habitat and with corresponding changes in species' ranges. Contemporary climate change and human disturbance may lead to rapid range expansion or contractions with largely unknown consequences. Birds provide an excellent case study of this phenomenon with some taxa expanding range and others contracting even to the point of extinction. What leads some populations to expand while others contract? Are there physiological and behavioral attributes of ``pioneers'' at the forefront of a range shift/expansion? The concept of allostasis provides a framework with which to begin to evaluate when a species will be able to successfully expand into new habitat. This tool allows the integration of normal energetic demands (e.g. wear and tear of daily and seasonal routines) with novel challenges posed by unfamiliar and human altered environments. Allostasis is particularly attractive because it allows assessment of how individual phenotypes may respond differentially to changing environments. Here, we use allostasis to evaluate what characteristics of individuals and their environment permit successful range expansion. Understanding variation in the regulatory mechanisms that influence response to a novel environment will be fundamental for understanding the phenotypes of pioneers.},

  abstract = {Shifts in tree species ranges may occur due to global climate change, which in turn may be exacerbated by natural disturbance events. Within the context of global climate change, developing techniques to monitor tree range dynamics as affected by natural disturbances may enable mitigation/adaptation of projected impacts. Using a forest inventory across the eastern U.S., the northern range margins of tree distributions were examined by comparing differences in the 95th percentile locations of seedlings to adults (i.e., trees) by 0.5\textdegree{} longitudinal bands over 5-years and by levels of disturbance (i.e., canopy gap formation). Our results suggest that the monitoring of tree range dynamics is complicated by the limits of forest inventory data across varying spatial/temporal scales and the diversity of tree species/environments in the eastern U.S. The vast majority of tree and seedling latitudinal comparisons across measurement periods and levels of disturbance in the study were not statistically different from zero (53 out of 60 comparisons). A potential skewing of ranges towards a northern limit was suggested by the stability of northern margins of tree ranges found in this study and shifts in mean locations identified in previous work. Only a partial influence of disturbances on tree range dynamics during the course of the 5-years was found in this study. The results of this study underscore the importance of continued examination of the role of disturbance in tree range dynamics and refined range monitoring techniques given future forest extent and biodiversity implications.},

The examination of tree species shifts in forests of the eastern United States largely has been limited to simulation activities due to a lack of consistent, long-term forest inventory datasets. The goal of this study was to compare current geographic distributions of tree seedlings (trees with a diameter at breast height 2.5 cm) with biomass (trees with a diameter at breast height {$>$} 2.5 cm) for sets of northern, southern, and general tree species in the eastern United States using a spatially balanced, region-wide forest inventory. Compared to mean latitude of tree biomass, mean latitude of seedlings was significantly farther north ({$>$}20 km) for the northern study species, while southern species had no shift, and general species demonstrated southern expansion. Density of seedlings relative to tree biomass of northern tree species was nearly 10 times higher in northern latitudes compared to southern latitudes. For forest inventory plots between 448 and 478 north latitude where southern tree species were identified, their biomass averaged 0.46 tonnes/ha while their seedling counts averaged 2600 ha{\`A}1. It is hypothesized that as northern and southern tree species together move northward due to greater regeneration success at higher latitudes, general species may fill their vacated niches in southern locations. The results of this study suggest that the process of northward tree migration in the eastern United States is currently underway with rates approaching 100 km/century for many species.},

We evaluate the possibility that a few principal drivers underpin network-level responses to climate change, and that these drivers can be studied to develop a more coherent theoretical framework than is currently provided by phenomenological approaches. For instance, warming will elevate individual ectotherm metabolic rates, and direct and indirect effects of changes in atmospheric conditions are expected to alter the stoichiometry of interactions between primary consumers and basal resources; these effects are general and pervasive, and will permeate through the entire networks that they affect. In addition, changes in the density and viscosity of aqueous media could alter interactions among very small organisms and disrupt the pycnoclines that currently compartmentalize many aquatic networks in time and space. We identify a range of approaches and potential model systems that are particularly well suited to network-level studies within the context of climate change. We also highlight potentially fruitful areas of research with a view to improving our predictive power regarding climate change impacts on networks.

  abstract = {While many dynamic processes have been proposed to produce diversity differences among communities, most empirical investigations focus on static system attributes. An ideal analysis would consider multiple dynamic processes and their impact on many community members, but such analyses can be logistically daunting. I compared Markov chain models of ecological communities to explore general processes leading to diversity differences of sessile species between coral reefs and rocky intertidal mussel beds. As predicted by diversity theory, high diversity coral reefs had lower species replacement probabilities and higher disturbance rates than did lower diversity mussel beds. Intransitivities in species replacements, recruitment limitation and responses to perturbing species from equilibrium (Jacobian elements) did not differ significantly between systems. Tradeoffs between the displacement risk or displacement ability of a species and either disturbance risk or colonising ability were not apparent. Manipulating the coral reef model to eliminate disturbance or intransitivities caused declines in species diversity, whereas removing recruitment limitation or increasing the probability of interspecific replacement did not. Higher overall disturbance levels can explain part of the diversity difference between systems, but much remained unexplained, indicating that details of the pattern and strengths of species interactions were probably extremely important.},

  abstract = {[Understanding and predicting the effects of species extinction and other environmental impacts in natural ecosystems is difficult because of their inherent complexity. Successful prediction in complex systems requires empirically accessible theoretical frameworks to limit the range of possible outcomes. I explored the predictions of multi-species Markov models, based on transition probabilities derived from repeated censuses of fixed points in the middle intertidal community of Tatoosh Island, Washington, USA, under natural conditions and after altering the model to reflect species extinction and changes in size-structured processes. The unmanipulated model predicted a mussel-dominated community and quantitatively captured 98.7\% of the variation in community composition in independent transects. Although model assumptions that transition probabilities did not vary over time and depended only on the state of a point at the previous census were violated, altering the model to account for these violations provided no improvement in model performance. The manipulated models indicated that most species and transitions had relatively weak effects on community composition, the strongest effects being associated with California mussels (Mytilus californianus), articulated coralline algae (Corallina vancouveriensis), and predatory birds. The manipulated models also predicted that extinction of several species, particularly predatory birds, affects the resilience of the system, as assessed by return time. The effects of species on composition and resilience were poorly correlated, suggesting that assessing the importance of species depends on the type of ecosystem response being considered. The model successfully predicted quantitative shifts in community composition and ecosystem dynamics under several novel conditions: on vertical walls where bird predation and adult mussel recruitment are absent, and in previously published experiments that excluded birds from horizontal benches. These results suggest that Markov models can provide a useful predictive framework for some types of environmental impacts on complex ecosystems.]},

  abstract = {A trade-off between growth and mortality rates characterizes tree species in closed canopy forests. This trade-off is maintained by inherent differences among species and spatial variation in light availability caused by canopy-opening disturbances. We evaluated conditions under which the trade-off is expressed and relationships with four key functional traits for 103 tree species from Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The trade-off is strongest for saplings for growth rates of the fastest growing individuals and mortality rates of the slowest growing individuals (r2 = 0.69), intermediate for saplings for average growth rates and overall mortality rates (r2 = 0.46), and much weaker for large trees (r2 {$\leq$} 0.10). This parallels likely levels of spatial variation in light availability, which is greatest for fast- vs. slow-growing saplings and least for large trees with foliage in the forest canopy. Inherent attributes of species contributing to the trade-off include abilities to disperse, acquire resources, grow rapidly, and tolerate shade and other stresses. There is growing interest in the possibility that functional traits might provide insight into such ecological differences and a growing consensus that seed mass (SM), leaf mass per area (LMA), wood density (WD), and maximum height (Hmax) are key traits among forest trees. Seed mass, LMA, WD, and Hmax are predicted to be small for light-demanding species with rapid growth and mortality and large for shade-tolerant species with slow growth and mortality. Six of these trait?demographic rate predictions were realized for saplings; however, with the exception of WD, the relationships were weak (r2 {$<$} 0.1 for three and r2 {$<$} 0.2 for five of the six remaining relationships). The four traits together explained 43?44\% of interspecific variation in species positions on the growth?mortality trade-off; however, WD alone accounted for {$>$}80\% of the explained variation and, after WD was included, LMA and Hmax made insignificant contributions. Virtually the full range of values of SM, LMA, and Hmax occurred at all positions on the growth?mortality trade-off. Although WD provides a promising start, a successful trait-based ecology of tropical forest trees will require consideration of additional traits.},

  abstract = {Although the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning has become a major focus in ecology, its significance in a f luctuating environment is still poorly understood. According to the insurance hypothesis, biodiversity insures ecosystems against declines in their functioning because many species provide greater guarantees that some will maintain functioning even if others fail. Here we examine this hypothesis theoretically. We develop a general stochastic dynamic model to assess the effects of species richness on the expected temporal mean and variance of ecosystem processes such as productivity, based on individual species' productivity responses to environmental f luctuations. Our model shows two major insurance effects of species richness on ecosystem productivity: (i) a buffering effect, i.e., a reduction in the temporal variance of productivity, and (ii) a performanceenhancing effect, i.e., an increase in the temporal mean of productivity. The strength of these insurance effects is determined by three factors: (i) the way ecosystem productivity is determined by individual species responses to environmental f luctuations, (ii) the degree of asynchronicity of these responses, and (iii) the detailed form of these responses. In particular, the greater the variance of the species responses, the lower the species richness at which the temporal mean of the ecosystem process saturates and the ecosystem becomes redundant. These results provide a strong theoretical foundation for the insurance hypothesis, which proves to be a fundamental principle for understanding the long-term effects of biodiversity on ecosystem processes.},

  abstract = {Ecologists frequently try to predict the future geographic distributions of species. Most studies assume that the current distribution of a species reflects its environmental requirements (i.e., the species' niche). However, the current distributions of many species are unlikely to be at equilibrium with the current distribution of environmental conditions, both because of ongoing invasions and because the distribution of suitable environmental conditions is always changing. This mismatch between the equilibrium assumptions inherent in many analyses and the disequilibrium conditions in the real world leads to inaccurate predictions of species' geographic distributions and suggests the need for theory and analytical tools that avoid equilibrium assumptions. Here, we develop a general theory of environmental associations during periods of transient dynamics. We show that time-invariant relationships between environmental conditions and rates of local colonization and extinction can produce substantial temporal variation in occupancy\textendash{}environment relationships. We then estimate occupancy\textendash{}environment relationships during three avian invasions. Changes in occupancy\textendash{}environment relationships over time differ among species but are predicted by dynamic occupancy models. Since estimates of the occupancy\textendash{}environment relationships themselves are frequently poor predictors of future occupancy patterns, research should increasingly focus on characterizing how rates of local colonization and extinction vary with environmental conditions.},

First, the principles and implementation of the model were described. Then the model was successfully applied to the simulation of land use change in Changping, a district of Beijing. Based on land use maps in years 1988 and 1998, the land use map in year 2008 was simulated. By analyzing the simulation result, the effectiveness of the model for land use change simulation was demonstrated. By comparing results simulated by this model and the results simulated by Markov-CA model with the actual land use map, the advantage of this model in spatial accuracy was shown.},

The results obtained by using contingency tables indicate that only yellow birch suffered significant damage, while the other species (sugar maple, white ash and beech) sustained no damage or light damage only.

  abstract = {Graph theory and network analysis have become established as promising ways to efficiently explore and analyze landscape or habitat connectivity. However, little attention has been paid to making these graphtheoretic approaches operational within landscape ecological assessments, planning, and design. In this paper, a set of both theoretical and practical methodological developments are presented to address this issue. In highly fragmented landscapes, many species are restricted to moving among small, scattered patches of different resources, instead of one, large patch. A life-cycle based approach is therefore introduced, in which a metapatch is constructed, spanning over these resources, scattered across the landscape. The importance of spatially explicit and geographically defined representations of the network in urban and regional planning and design is stressed, and appropriate, context-dependent visualizations of these are suggested based on experience from real-world planning cases. The study moves beyond the issue of conservation of currently important structures, and seeks to identify suitable redesigns of the landscape to improve its social\textendash{}ecological qualities, or increase resilience. By introducing both a system-centric and a site-centric analysis, two conflicting perspectives can be addressed. The first answers the question ``what can I do for the network'', and the second, ``what can the network do for me''. A method for typical planning strategies within each of these perspectives is presented. To illustrate the basic principles of the proposed methods, an ecological study on the European common toad (Bufo bufo) in Stockholm, Sweden is presented, using the betweenness centrality index to capture important stepping-stone structures.},

We speculate that stand history effectively overrode the direct effects of colder climate on maple growth along the S-N gradient. Regeneration of maple in the southern sites likely occurred in canopy gaps, whereas in the north it was contingent upon large disturbances such as stand-replacing fires, which apparently provided more favorable light environment for maple growth than canopy gaps. The annual growth variability, which reflects effects of annual weather on growth and is largely independent from the absolute growth rate, was significantly affected by monthly climate, suggesting a positive effect of higher summer temperature in the northern part of the transect (48\textendash{}49\textdegree{}N) and a negative effect of summer drought in the south (47\textendash{}48\textdegree{}N). In the future, the natural and human disturbance regimes will be dominant controls of the actual biomass productivity of red maple at the northern limit of its present distribution range. Direct effects of climate on maple growth would likely be less important in this context, and will likely entail negative effect of increased summer drought in the southern part of the study area and positive effects of increased temperatures in the north.},

  abstract = {Many empirical studies of metacommunities have focused on the classification of observational patterns into four contrasting paradigms characterized by different levels of movement and habitat heterogeneity. However, deeper insight into the underlying local and regional processes may be derived from a combination of long-term observational data and experimental studies. With the aim of exploring forces structuring the insect metacommunity on oak, we fit a hierarchical Bayesian state-space model to data from observations and experiments. The fitted model reveals large variation in species-specific dispersal abilities and basic reproduction numbers, R0. The residuals from the model show only weak correlations among species, suggesting a lack of strong interspecific interactions. Simulations with modelderived parameter estimates indicate that habitat configuration and species attributes both contribute substantially to structuring insect communities. Overall, our findings demonstrate that community-level variation in movement and life history are key drivers of metacommunity dynamics.},

  abstract = {Tree species are predicted to track future climate by shifting their geographic distributions, but climate-mediated migrations are not apparent in a recent continental-scale analysis. To better understand the mechanisms of a possible migration lag, we analyzed relative recruitment patterns by comparing juvenile and adult tree abundances in climate space. One would expect relative recruitment to be higher in cold and dry climates as a result of tree migration with juveniles located further poleward than adults. Alternatively, relative recruitment could be higher in warm and wet climates as a result of higher tree population turnover with increased temperature and precipitation. Using the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis data at regional scales, we jointly modeled juvenile and adult abundance distributions for 65 tree species in climate space of the eastern United States. We directly compared the optimal climate conditions for juveniles and adults, identified the climates where each species has high relative recruitment, and synthesized relative recruitment patterns across species. Results suggest that for 77\% and 83\% of the tree species, juveniles have higher optimal temperature and optimal precipitation, respectively, than adults. Across species, the relative recruitment pattern is dominated by relatively more abundant juveniles than adults in warm and wet climates. These different abundance-climate responses through life history are consistent with faster population turnover and inconsistent with the geographic trend of large-scale tree migration. Taken together, this juvenile\textendash{}adult analysis suggests that tree species might respond to climate change by having faster turnover as dynamics accelerate with longer growing seasons and higher temperatures, before there is evidence of poleward migration at biogeographic scales.},

  abstract = {Tree species are expected to track warming climate by shifting their ranges to higher latitudes or elevations, but current evidence of latitudinal range shifts for suites of species is largely indirect. In response to global warming, offspring of trees are predicted to have ranges extend beyond adults at leading edges and the opposite relationship at trailing edges. Large-scale forest inventory data provide an opportunity to compare present latitudes of seedlings and adult trees at their range limits. Using the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis data, we directly compared seedling and tree 5th and 95th percentile latitudes for 92 species in 30 longitudinal bands for 43 334 plots across the eastern United States. We further compared these latitudes with 20th century temperature and precipitation change and functional traits, including seed size and seed spread rate. Results suggest that 58.7\% of the tree species examined show the pattern expected for a population undergoing range contraction, rather than expansion, at both northern and southern boundaries. Fewer species show a pattern consistent with a northward shift (20.7\%) and fewer still with a southward shift (16.3\%). Only 4.3\% are consistent with expansion at both range limits. When compared with the 20th century climate changes that have occurred at the range boundaries themselves, there is no consistent evidence that population spread is greatest in areas where climate has changed most; nor are patterns related to seed size or dispersal characteristics. The fact that the majority of seedling extreme latitudes are less than those for adult trees may emphasize the lack of evidence for climate-mediated migration, and should increase concerns for the risks posed by climate change.},

  abstract = {Conservation and management actions often have direct and indirect effects on a wide range of species. As such, it is important to evaluate the impacts that such actions may have on both target and non-target species within a region. Understanding how species richness and composition differ as a result of management treatments can help determine potential ecological consequences. Yet it is difficult to estimate richness because traditional sampling approaches detect species at variable rates and some species are never observed. We present a framework for assessing management actions on biodiversity using a multi-species hierarchical model that estimates individual species occurrences, while accounting for imperfect detection of species. Our model incorporates species-specific responses to management treatments and local vegetation characteristics and a hierarchical component that links species at a community-level. This allows for comprehensive inferences on the whole community or on assemblages of interest. Compared to traditional species models, occurrence estimates are improved for all species, even for those that are rarely observed, resulting in more precise estimates of species richness (including species that were unobserved during sampling). We demonstrate the utility of this approach for conservation through an analysis comparing bird communities in two geographically similar study areas: one in which white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) densities have been regulated through hunting and one in which deer densities have gone unregulated. Although our results indicate that species and assemblage richness were similar in the two study areas, point-level richness was significantly influenced by local vegetation characteristics, a result that would have been underestimated had we not accounted for variability in species detection.},

  abstract = {Increasing biodiversity loss due to climate change is one of the most vital challenges of the 21st century. To anticipate and mitigate biodiversity loss, models are needed that reliably project species' range dynamics and extinction risks. Recently, several new approaches to model range dynamics have been developed to supplement correlative species distribution models (SDMs), but applications clearly lag behind model development. Indeed, no comparative analysis has been performed to evaluate their performance. Here, we build on process-based, simulated data for benchmarking five range (dynamic) models of varying complexity including classical SDMs, SDMs coupled with simple dispersal or more complex population dynamic models (SDM hybrids), and a hierarchical Bayesian process-based dynamic range model (DRM). We specifically test the effects of demographic and community processes on model predictive performance. Under current climate, DRMs performed best, although only marginally. Under climate change, predictive performance varied considerably, with no clear winners. Yet, all range dynamic models improved predictions under climate change substantially compared to purely correlative SDMs, and the population dynamic models also predicted reasonable extinction risks for most scenarios. When benchmarking data were simulated with more complex demographic and community processes, simple SDM hybrids including only dispersal often proved most reliable. Finally, we found that structural decisions during model building can have great impact on model accuracy, but prior system knowledge on important processes can reduce these uncertainties considerably. Our results reassure the clear merit in using dynamic approaches for modelling species' response to climate change but also emphasize several needs for further model and data improvement. We propose and discuss perspectives for improving range projections through combination of multiple models and for making these approaches operational for large numbers of species.},
