\chapter*{Abstract}


The main objective of my thesis was to understand and quantify the combined
effect of recent climate change and disturbances on forest community dynamics in
the boreal-temperate ecotone over the past decades. To do so, I analysed the evolution of forest composition, transition dynamics and recruitment dynamics in Quebec from 1970 to 2018.


In the first chapter, I showed that natural and anthropogenic disturbances are
the main drivers of forest compositional change, i.e. temporal $\beta$
diversity. Despite the prevalence of disturbances, analysis of community
ecological traits revealed a thermophilization of forests across
Québec, i.e. an increase of warm-adapted species at the expense of cold-adapted
species. This thermophilization was further amplified by moderate
disturbances, leading to a new question: if disturbances can favour such a
community reorganization, could they catalyse a permanent shift to alternative
states?

The second chapter provided answers to this question with an analysis of forest transition dynamics in Québec based on a four-state model, i.e. boreal, mixed, temperate and pioneer. Transition dynamics are primarily influenced by
disturbances and secondarily by climate and edaphic conditions. Major
disturbances mainly trigger transitions to the pioneer state, while moderate
disturbances promote transitions from mixed to temperate states. In the long
run, moderate disturbances may catalyse a faster northward shift of the
temperate-boreal ecotone under climate change. However, contrary to my
expectations, temperate species recruitment played a negligible role in this
dynamic compared to mortality and growth processes.

The first two chapters were focussing on the evolution of mature tree communities.
However, to understand forest dynamics, a detailed analysis of regeneration
dynamics is necessary. Such a study was conducted in the third chapter where I
highlighted northward shifts of several kilometres for the saplings of
*Acer rubrum*, *Acer saccharum* and *Betula alleghaniensis* in undisturbed
forests. However, under the influence of moderate disturbances, only *Acer spp.*
had migrated and there were no shifts under the influence of major disturbances. In
contrast, I found no evidence of migration for the saplings of *Fagus
grandifolia*. Although partial cutting increased recruitment success of all four
species, it did not result in larger northward range shifts, presumably because
recruitment was constrained by short-distance dispersal, strong competition by
boreal species, and unfavourable edaphic conditions.

Overall, my results highlighted that forest communities in the temperate-boreal
ecotone are already changing in response to recent climate warming and that
disturbances are accelerating this response. While climate warming erodes the resilience of mixed forests, disturbances remove resident boreal species, thereby accelerating the successional process and facilitating the establishment of temperate species.
